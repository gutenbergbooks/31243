<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Twenty years ago the author started a career in technological
journalism by writing descriptions of what he regarded as the most
promising inventions which had been displayed in international
exhibitions then recently held. From that time until the present it
has been his constant duty and practice to take note of the advance of
inventive science as applied to industrial improvement&mdash;to watch it as
an organic growth, not only from a philosophical, but also from a
practical, point of view. The advance towards the actual adoption of
any great industrial invention is generally a more or less collective
movement; and, in the course of a practice such as that referred to,
the habit of watching the signs of progress has been naturally
acquired.</p>

<p>Moreover, it has always been necessary to take
a comprehensive, rather than a minute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
or detailed, view of the progress of the great industrial
army of nineteenth century civilisation towards certain
objectives. It is better, for some purposes of technological
journalism, to be attached to the staff than to march with any
individual company&mdash;for the war correspondent must ever place himself
in a position from which a bird's-eye view is possible. The personal
aspect of the campaign becomes merged in that which regards the army
as an organic unit.</p>

<p>It may, therefore, be claimed that, in some moderate degree, the
author is fitted by training and opportunities for undertaking the
necessarily difficult task of foretelling the trend of invention and
industrial improvement during the twentieth century. He must, of
course, expect to be wrong in a certain proportion of his
prognostications; but, like the meteorologists, he will be content if
in a fair percentage of his forecasts it should be admitted that he
has reasoned correctly according to the available data.</p>

<p>The questions to be answered in an inquiry as to the chances of
failure or success which lie before any invention or proposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
improvement are, first, whether it is really wanted; and, secondly,
whether the environment in the midst of which it must make its d&eacute;but
is favourable. These requirements generally depend upon matters which,
to a large extent, stand apart from the personal qualifications of any
individual inventor.</p>

<p>In the course of a search through the vast accumulations of the
patent specifications of various countries, the thought is almost
irresistibly forced upon the mind of the investigator that "there is
nothing new under the sun". No matter how far back he may push his
inquiry in attempting to unveil the true source of any important idea,
he will always find at some antecedent date the germ, either of
the same inventive conception, or of something which is hardly
distinguishable from it. The habit of research into the origin of
improved industrial method must therefore help to strengthen the
impression of the importance of gradual growth, and of general
tendencies, as being the prime factors in promoting social advancement
through the success of invention.</p>

<p>The same habit will also generally have the effect
of rendering the searcher more diffident
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
in any claims which he may entertain as to
the originality of his own ideas. Inventive thought has been so
enormously stimulated during the past two or three generations, that
the public recognition of a want invariably sets thousands of minds
thinking about the possible methods of ministering to it.</p>

<p>Startling illustrations of this fact are continually cropping up in
the experiences of patent agents and others who are engaged in
technological work and its literature. The average inventor is almost
always inclined to imagine&mdash;when he finds another man working in
exactly the same groove as himself&mdash;that by some means his ideas have
leaked out, and have been pirated. But those who have studied
invention, as a social and industrial force, know that nothing is more
common than to find two or more inventors making entirely independent
progress in the same direction.</p>

<p>For example, while this book was in course of preparation the author wrote
out an account of an application of wireless telegraphy to the purpose of
keeping all the clocks within a given area correct to one standard time. Within
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
a few days there came to hand a copy of <i>Engineering</i> in which exactly
the same suggestion was put forward, and an announcement was made to
the effect that Mr. Richard Kerr, F.G.S., had been working
independently on the same lines, the details of his method of applying
the Hertzian waves to the purpose being practically the same as those
sketched out by the author. This is only one of several instances of
coincidences in independent work which have been noticed during the
period while this volume was in course of preparation.</p>

<p>It may, therefore, be readily understood that the author would hardly
like to undertake the task of attempting to discriminate between those
forecasts in the subsequent pages which are the results of his own
original suggestions, and those which have been derived from other
sources. Whatever is of value has in all probability been thought of,
or perhaps patented and otherwise publicly suggested, before. At any
rate, the great majority of the forecasts are based on actual records
of the trials of inventions which distinctly have a future lying
before them in the years of the twentieth century.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
In declining to enter into questions relating to the original
authorship of the improvements or discoveries discussed, it should not
be supposed that any wish is implied to detract from the merits of
inventors and promoters of inventions, either individually or
collectively. Many of these are the heroes and statesmen of that great
nation which is gradually coming to be recognised as a true entity
under the name of Civilisation. Their life's work is to elevate
humanity, and if mankind paid more attention to them, and to what they
are thinking and doing, instead of setting so much store by the
veriest tittle-tattle of what is called political life, it would make
much faster progress.</p>

<p>Some of the industrial improvements referred to in the succeeding
pages are necessarily sketched in an indefinite manner. The outlines,
as it were, have been only roughed in; and no attempt has been made to
supply particulars, which in fact would be out of place in an essay
towards a comprehensive survey in so small a space. It is upon the
wise and skilful arrangement of details that sound and commercially
profitable patents are usually founded, rather than upon the broad general
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
principles of a proposed industrial advance or reform.</p>

<p>During the twentieth century this latter fact, already well recognised
by experts in what is known as industrial property, will doubtless
force itself more and more upon the attention of inventors. Every
specification will require to be drawn up with the very greatest care
in observing the truth taught by the fable of the boy and the jar of
nuts. So rapidly does the mass of bygone patent records accumulate,
that almost any kind of claim based upon very wide foundations will be
found to have trenched upon ground already in some degree taken up.</p>

<p>Probably there is hardly anything indicated in this work which is
not&mdash;in the strict sense of the rules laid down for examiners in those
countries which make search as to originality&mdash;common public property.
The labour involved in gathering the data for a forecast of the inventions
likely to produce important effects during the twentieth century has been
chiefly that of selecting from out of a vast mass of heterogeneous ideas
those which give promise of springing up amidst favourable conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
and of growing to large proportions and bearing valuable
fruit. Such ideas, when planted in the soil of the collective
mind through the medium of official or other records, generally
require for their germination a longer time than that for which the
patent laws grant protection for industrial property. Many of them,
indeed, have formed the subjects of patents which, from one reason or
another, lapsed long before the expiration of the maximum terms.
Nature is ever prodigal of seeds and of "seed-thoughts" but
comparatively niggardly of places in which the young plant will find
exactly the kind of soil, air, rain, and sunshine which the young
plant needs.</p>

<p>If any one requires proof of this statement he will find ample
evidence in support of it in the tenth chapter of Smiles's work on
<i>Industrial Biography</i>, where facts and dates are adduced to show that
steam locomotion, reaping machines, balloons, gunpowder, macadamised
roads, coal gas, photography, an&aelig;sthesia, and even telegraphy are
inventions which, so far as concerns the germ idea on which their
success has been based, are of very much older origin than the world generally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
supposes. The author, therefore, submits that he is justified
in referring inventions to the century in which they produce
successful results, not to that in which they may have been first
vaguely thought of. And in this view it is obvious that many of those
patents and suggestions which have been published in current
literature during the nineteenth century, but which, although pregnant
with mighty industrial influences, have not yet reached fruition, are
essentially inventions of the twentieth century. More than this, it is
extremely probable that the great majority of those ideas which will
move the industrial world during the next ensuing hundred years have
already been indicated, more or less clearly, by the inventive thought
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>INVENTIVE PROGRESS.</h3>


<p>The year 1801, the first of the nineteenth
century, was <i>annus mirabilis</i> in the industrial
history of mankind. It was in that
year that the railway locomotive was invented
by Richard Trevithick, who had studied the
steam engine under a friend and assistant of
James Watt. His patent, which was secured
during the ensuing year, makes distinct mention
of the use of his locomotive driven by
steam upon tramways; and in 1803 he actually
had an engine running on the Pen-y-Darran
mining tramway in Cornwall. From that small
beginning has grown a system of railway communication
which has brought the farthest
inland regions of mighty continents within easy
reach of the seaboard and of the world's great
markets; which has made social and friendly
intercourse possible in millions of homes which
otherwise would have been almost destitute of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
it; which has been the means of spreading a
knowledge of literature, science and religion
over the face of the civilised world; and which,
at the present moment, constitutes the outward
and visible sign of the difference between
Western civilisation and that of the Asiatic, as
seen in China.</p>

<p>In another corner of the globe, during the
year 1801, Volta was constructing his first apparatus
demonstrating the material and physical
nature of those mysterious electric currents
which his friend Professor Galvani of Bologna,
who died just two years earlier, had at first ascribed
to a physiological source. The researches
of the latter, it will be remembered, were begun
in an observation of the way in which the legs
of a dead frog twitched under certain conditions.
The voltaic pile was the first electric battery,
and, therefore, the parent of the existing
marvellous telegraphic and telephonic systems,
while less immediately it led to the development
of the dynamo and its work in electric lighting
and traction. It brought into harmony much
fragmentary knowledge which had lain disjointed
in the armoury of the physicist since
Dufay in France and Franklin in America
had investigated their theories of positive and
negative frictional electricities, and had connected
them with the flash of lightning as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
seen in Nature. Thus it became a fresh starting
point both for industry and for science.</p>

<p>At the Exposition of National Industry, held
in Paris during the year 1801, a working model
of the Jacquard loom was exhibited&mdash;the prototype
of those remarkable pieces of mechanism
by which the most elaborately figured designs
are worked upon fabrics during the process of
weaving by means of sets of perforated cardboards.
This was the crowning achievement
of the inventions relating to textile fabrics,
which had rendered the latter half of the
eighteenth century so noteworthy in an industrial
sense. It brought artistic designs in
articles of common use within the reach of
even poor people, and has been the means of
unconsciously improving the public taste, in
matters of applied art, more rapidly than could
have been accomplished by an army of trained
artists. The riots in which the mob nearly
drowned Jacquard at Lyons for attempting to
set up some of his looms were very nearly a
counterpart of those which had occurred in
England in connection with the introduction
of spinning, weaving and knitting machinery.</p>

<p>In Paris, during the first year of the nineteenth
century, Robert Fulton, an American,
and friend of the United States representative
in France, was making trials on the Seine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
with his first steam-boat&mdash;a little vessel imitated
by him later on in the first successful
steamers which plied on the river Hudson,
carrying passengers from New York. At the
same time, William Symongton launched the
<i>Charlotte Dundas</i>, the steam tug-boat which,
on the Scottish canals, did the first actually
useful work in the conveyance of goods by
steam power on the water. These small
experiments have initiated a movement in
maritime transport which is fully comparable
to that brought about on land by the invention
of the railway locomotive.</p>

<p>Again, in 1801, Sir Humphry Davy gave
his first lecture at the Royal Institution in
London, where he had just been installed as
a professor, and began that long series of
investigations into the chemistry of common
things which, taken up by his successor Faraday,
gave to the United Kingdom the first
start in some of those industries depending
upon a knowledge of organic chemistry and
the use of certain essential oils.</p>

<p>Public attention at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, however, was directed
anywhere but towards these small commencements
of mighty forces which were to revolutionise
the industrial world, and through it
also the social and political. If in those days
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Cornwall was ever referred to, it was not by
any means in connection with Trevithick and
his steam-engine which would run on rails,
but by way of reference to the relations of the
Prince of Wales to the Duchy, and the proportion
of its revenues which belonged to him
from birth.</p>

<p>Glancing over the pages of any history
compiled in the early half of the century,
the eye will trace hardly the barest allusions
to forces, the discoveries in which were, in
the year 1801, still in the incipient stage.
Canon Hughes, for instance, in his continuation
of the histories of Hume and Smollett,
devoted some forty pages to the record of
that year. The space which he could spare
from the demands made upon his attention
by the wars in Spain and Egypt, and the
naval conflict with France, was mainly occupied
with such matters as the election of the
Rev. Horne Tooke for Old Sarum, and the
burning question as to whether that gentleman
had not rendered himself permanently
ineligible for Parliamentary honours through
taking Holy Orders, and with a miscellaneous
mass of topics relating to the merely evanescent
politics of the day.</p>

<p>The whole of the effects of invention and
discovery in making history during the first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
year of the century were dismissed by this
writer with a casual reference to the augmentation
of the productive power of the labouring
population through the use of machinery, and
a footnote stating that "this was more particularly
the case in the cotton manufacture".</p>

<p>Time corrects the historical perspective of
the past, but it does not very materially alter
the power of the historical vision to adjust
itself to an examination of the present day
forces which are likely to grow to importance
in the making of future history. When we
ask what are the inventions and discoveries
which are really destined to grow from seeds
of the nineteenth into trees of the twentieth
century, we are at once confronted with the
same kind of difficulty which would present
itself to one who, standing in the midst of an
ancient forest, should be requested to indicate
in what spots the wide-spreading giants of the
next generation of trees might be expected to
grow. The company promoter labels those
inventions in which he is commercially interested
as the affairs which will grow to huge
dimensions in the future; while the man of
scientific or mechanical bent is very apt to
predict a mighty future only for achievements
which strike him as being peculiarly brilliant.</p>

<p>Patent experts, on the other hand, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
asked by their clients to state candidly what
class of inventions may be relied upon to
bring the most certain returns, generally reply
that "big money usually comes from small
patents". In other words, an invention embodying
some comparatively trivial, but yet
really serviceable, improvement on a very
widely used type of machine; or a little bit of
apparatus which in some small degree facilitates
some well known process; or a fashionable
toy or puzzle likely to have a good run for a
season or two, and then a moderate sale for a
few years longer; these are the things to be
recommended to an inventor whose main
object is to make money. Thus the most
qualified experts in patent law and practice
do not fail to disclose this fact to those who
seek their professional advice in a money-making
spirit, as the great majority of inventors
do.</p>

<p>The full term of fourteen years in the
United Kingdom, or seventeen in the United
States, may be a ridiculously long period for
which to grant a monopoly to the inventor of
some ephemeral toy, although absolutely inadequate
to secure the just reward for one
who labours for many years to perfect an
epoch-making invention, and then to introduce
it to the public in the face of all the opposition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
from vested interests which such inventions
almost invariably meet.</p>

<p>Thus the fact that a man has made money
out of one class of patents may not be any safe
guide at all to arriving at a due estimate of his
ideas on industrial improvements of greater
"pith and moment," but, on the contrary, it is
generally exactly the reverse. The law offers
an immense premium for such inventions as
are readily introduced, and the inventor who
has made it his business to take advantage of
this fact is usually one of the last men from
whom to get a trustworthy opinion on patents
of a different class.</p>

<p>Of the patents taken out during the latter
portion of the nineteenth century, many undoubtedly
contain the germs of great ideas,
and, nevertheless, have excited comparatively
little attention from business men or from the
general public. It was so in the latter part of
the eighteenth century, and history is only
repeating itself when the seeds of twentieth
century industrial movements are permitted
to germinate unseen.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes each invention must
be referred to the age in which it actually does
useful work in the service of mankind. Thus,
Hero of Alexandria, in the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
devised a water fountain worked by the expansive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
power of steam. From time to time
during the succeeding twenty centuries similar
pieces of apparatus excited the curiosity of the
inquisitive and the interest of the learned.
The clever and eccentric Marquis of Worcester,
in his little book published in 1663, <i>A Century
of the Names and Scantlings of Inventions</i>, generally
known as the <i>Century of Inventions</i>, gave
an account of one application of the power of
steam to lift water which he had worked out,
probably on a scale large enough to have become
of practical service. Thomas Savery
and Denis Papin, both of them men of high
attainments and great ingenuity, made important
improvements before the end of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Yet, if we refer to the question as to the
proper age to which the steam-engine as a
useful invention is to be assigned, we shall
unhesitatingly speak of it as an eighteenth
century invention, and this notwithstanding
the fact that Savery's patent for the first
pumping engine which came into practical
use was dated 1698. The real introduction
of steam as a factor in man's daily work was
effected later on, partly by Savery himself
and partly by Newcomen, and above all by
James Watt. The expiration of Watt's vital
patent occurred in 1800, and he himself then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
retired from the active supervision of his
engineering business, having virtually finished
his great life's work on the last year of the
century which he had marked for all time by
the efforts of his genius.</p>

<p>Similarly we may confidently characterise
the locomotive engine as an invention belonging
to the first half of the nineteenth century,
although tramways on the one hand, and steam-engines
on the other hand, were ready for the
application of steam transport, and the only
work that remained to be accomplished in the
half century indicated was the bringing of
the two things together. The dynamo, as a
factor in human life&mdash;or, in other words, the
electric current as a form of energy producing
power and light&mdash;is an invention of the second
half of the nineteenth century, although the
main principles upon which it was built were
worked out prior to the year 1851.</p>

<p>It will be seen, in the course of the subsequent
pages, that portable electric power has
as yet won its way only into very up-to-date
workshops and mines, and that the means by
which it will be applied to numerous useful
purposes in the field, the road, and the house
will be distinctly inventions of the twentieth
century. Similarly the steam-engine has not
really been placed upon the ordinary road,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
although efforts have been made for more than
a century to put it there, the conception of a
road locomotive being, in fact, an earlier one
than that of an engine running on rails. Steam
automobiles and traction engines are still confined
to special purposes, the natures of which
prove that certain elements of adaptability
are still lacking in order to render them universally
useful as are the locomotive and the
steam-ship.</p>

<p>In nearly every other important line of
human needs and desires it will be found
that merely tentative efforts have been made
by ingenious minds resulting in inventions of
greater or less promise. Many of the finest
conceptions which have necessarily been set
down as failures have missed fulfilling their
intended missions, not so much by reason of
inherent weakness, as through the want of
accessory circumstances to assist them. As
in biology, so in industrial progress the definition
of fitness appended to the law of the
survival of the fittest must have reference to
the environment.</p>

<p>A foolish law or public prejudice results in
the temporary failure of a great invention, and
the inventor's patent succumbs to the inexorable
operation of the struggle for existence.
Yet, fortunately for mankind, if not for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
individual inventor, an idea does not suffer
extinction as the penalty for non-success in
the struggle. "The beginning of creation," says
Carlyle, "is light," and the kind of light which
inventors throw upon the dark problems involving
man's industrial progress is providentially
indestructible.</p>

<p>Twentieth century inventions&mdash;as the term
is used in this book&mdash;are, therefore, those
which are destined to fulfil their missions
during the ensuing hundred years. They are
those whose light will not only exist in hidden
places, but will also shine abroad to help and
to bless mankind. Or, if we may revert to the
former figure, they are those which have not
only been planted in the seed and have germinated
in the leaf, but which have grown to
goodly proportions, so that none may dare to
assert that they have been planted for nought.
A man's age is the age in which he does his
work rather than that in which he struggles
to years of maturity. Moore and Byron were
poets of the nineteenth century, although the
one had attained to manhood and the other
had grown from poverty to inherit a peerage
before the new century dawned.</p>

<p>The prophetic r&ocirc;le&mdash;although proverbially an unsafe one&mdash;is
nevertheless one which every business man must play almost every day of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
his life. The merchant, the manufacturer, the publisher, the
director, the manager, and even the artist, must perforce stake some
portion of his success in life upon the chance of his forecast as to
the success of a particular speculation, article of manufacture, or
artistic conception, and its prospects of proving as attractive or
remunerative as he has expected it to be. The successful business man
no doubt makes his plans, as far as may be practicable, upon the
system indicated by the humorist, who advises people never to prophesy
unless they happen to know, but the nature of his knowledge is almost
always to some extent removed from certainty. He may spend much time
in laborious searching; make many inquiries from persons whom he
believes to be competent to advise him; diligently study the
conditions upon which the problem before him depends&mdash;in short, he may
take every reasonable precaution against the chances of failure, yet,
in spite of all, he must necessarily incur risks. And so it is with
regard to the task of forecasting the trend of industrial improvement.
All who are called upon to lay their plans for a number of years
beforehand must necessarily be deeply interested in the problems
relating to the various directions which the course of that improvement may possibly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
take. Meanwhile their estimates of the
future, although based upon an intimate knowledge of the past and
aided by naturally clear powers of insight, must be hypothetical and
conditional. Unfortunately for the vast majority of manufacturing
experts, the thoroughness with which they have mastered the details of
one particular branch of industry too often blinds them to the chances
of change arising from localities beyond their own restricted fields
of vision.</p>

<p>The merriment occasioned by the first proposals
for affixing pneumatic tyres to bicycles
may be cited as a striking instance of the lack
of forecasting insight displayed by very many
of those who are best entitled to pronounce
opinions on the minutiae of their particular
avocations. In almost every "bike" shop
and factory throughout the United Kingdom
and America, the suggestion of putting an
air-filled hosepipe around each wheel of the
machine to act as a tyre was received with
shouts of ridicule!</p>

<p>Railway men, who understood the wonderful
elasticity imparted by air to pieces of mechanism,
such as the pneumatic brake, were not by
any means so much inclined to laughter; but
naturally, for the most part, they deferred to
the rule which enjoins every man to stick to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
his trade. The rule in question&mdash;when applied
to the task of estimating the worth of inventions
claiming to produce revolutionary effects
in any industry&mdash;is necessarily, in the majority
of cases, more or less irrelevant, because such
an invention should be regarded not so much
as a proposed <i>innovation</i> in an old trade as the
<i>creation</i> of a new one.</p>

<p>George Stephenson's ideas on the transport
of passengers and goods were almost unanimously
condemned by the experts of his day
who were engaged in that line of business.
On points relating to wheels of waggons and
the harness of horses, the opinions of these
men were probably worth something; but
in relation to steam locomotives, carriages
and trucks running upon rails, their judgment
was not merely worthless, but a good deal
worse; it was indeed actually misleading, because
based on a pretence of knowledge of a
trade which was to be called into existence to
compete with their own. "Great is Diana of
the Ephesians" said the artificers of old; and
on the strength of their expert knowledge in
the making of idols they set themselves up as
judges of systems of theology and morality.
The argument, although based on self-interest
subjectively, was nevertheless intended to
carry weight even among persons who wished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to judge the questions in dispute according
to their merits, and most of the latter were
only too ready to accept the implied dictum
that men who work about a temple must be
experts in theology! The principles upon
which Royal Commissions and Select Committees
are sometimes appointed and entrusted
with the onerous duty of deciding upon far-reaching
industrial problems, affecting the
progress of trade and manufactures in the
present day, involve exactly the same kind
of fallacy. Men are selected to pronounce
judgment upon the proposals of their rivals in
trade, and narrow-minded specialists to give
their opinions upon projects which essentially
belong to the border lands between two or
more branches of industry, and cannot be
understood by persons not possessing a knowledge
of both.</p>

<p>Yet the world's work goes on apace; and as capital is accumulated and
seeks to find new outlets the multiplication of industrial projects
must continue in spite of every discouragement. This process will go
on at a rate even faster than that which was exhibited at the
beginning of the nineteenth century; but in watching the course of
advancement, the world must take count of ideas rather than of the
names of those who may have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
claims to rank as the originators of
ideas. While for purposes of convenience, history labels certain great
inventive movements, each with the name of one pre-eminent individual
who has contributed largely to its success, nothing like a due
appraisement of the services rendered by other men is ever attempted.
It is not even as if the commanding general should by public
acclamation receive all the applause for a successful campaign to the
exclusion of his lieutenants. The pioneers in each great department of
invention have generally acted as forerunners of the men whose names
have become the most famous. They have borne much of the heat and
burden of the day, while their successors have reaped the fruits of
triumph. Mr. Herbert Spencer's strong protest against the part
assigned by some writers in the mental and industrial evolution of the
human race to the influence of great men is certainly fully justified,
if the attribute of greatness is to be ascribed only to those whose
names figure in current histories. The parts performed by others,
whose fate it may have been to have fallen into comparatively
unfavourable environments, may have entitled them even more eminently
to the acclamation of greatness.</p>

<p>The world in such a matter asks, reasonably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
enough under the circumstances, Shall
we omit to honour any of the great men who
have played important parts in an industrial
movement, assigning as our motive the difficulty
of enumerating so many names? For
the encouragement of those to whom the
ambition for fame acts as a great stimulus to
self-devotion in the interests of human progress,
it is unavoidable that some men should
be singled out and made heroes, while the
much more numerous class of those who have
also done great work, but who have not been
quite so successful, must pass out of the ken
of all, excepting the few who possess an expert
knowledge of the various subjects which they
have taken in hand.</p>

<p>Still the distortion to which history has
been subjected through its biographical mode
of treatment must always be reckoned with as
a factor of possible error by any one attempting
to read the riddle of the past, and it may offer
a still more dangerous snare to one who tries
to deduce the future course of events from the
evidences of the past, and the promises which
they hold out. People are naturally prone to
take it for granted that the world's progress
during the first part of the twentieth century
depends upon the future work of those inventors
and industrial promoters whose names
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
have become most famous during the latter
half of the nineteenth. But this personal treatment
of the subject will be found to be in the
last degree unsatisfactory, when judged in the
light both of past experience and of some of
the utterances of those eminent inventors who
have tried to forecast the future in their own
particular lines of research.</p>

<p>If, therefore, we look at the whole subject
from the entirely impersonal point of view, and
face the task of forecasting the progress of
industry during the twentieth century, in this
aspect we shall find that we have entered
upon a chapter in the evolution of the human
race&mdash;dealing, in fact, with a branch of anthropology.
We see certain industrial and inventive
forces at work, producing certain initial effects,
but plainly, as yet, falling immeasurably short
of an entire fulfilment of their possibilities;
setting to work a multitude of busy brains,
planning and arranging, and gradually preparing
the minds of the more apathetic portion
of humanity for the reception of new ideas and
the adoption of improved methods of life and of
work. Whither is it all tending? Will the
twentieth century bring about as great a
change upon the earth&mdash;man's habitat&mdash;as the
nineteenth did? Or have the possibilities
of really great and effective industrial revolutions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
been practically exhausted? The
belief impressed upon the Author's mind, by
facts and considerations evoked during the
collection of materials for this book, is that the
march of industrial progress is only just beginning,
and that the twentieth century will
witness a far greater development than the
nineteenth has seen.</p>

<p>The great majority of mankind still require
to be released from the drudgery of irksome,
physical exertion, which, when power has been
cheapened, will be seen to be to a very large
extent avoidable. Pleasurable exercise will be
substituted for the monotonous, manual labour
which, while it continues, generally precludes
the possibility of mental improvement. Hygienic
science will insist more strenuously than
ever upon the great truth that, in order to be
really serviceable in promoting the health of
mind and body, physical exertion must be in
some degree exhilarating, and the bad old
practice of "all work and no play," which was
based upon the assumption that a boy can
get as much good out of chopping wood for
an hour as out of a bicycle ride or a game of
cricket, will be relegated to the limbo of
exploded fallacies.</p>

<p>The race, as a whole, will be athletic in
the same sense in which cultured ladies and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
gentlemen are at present. It will, a century
hence, offer a still more striking contrast to the
existing state of the Chinese, who bandage
their women's feet in order to show that they
are high born and never needed to walk or
to exert themselves!&mdash;the assumption being
that no one would ever move a muscle
unless under fear of the lash of poverty or of
actual hunger. The farther Western civilisation
travels from that effete Eastern ideal,
the greater will be the hope for human progress
in physical, mental and moral well-being.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>NATURAL POWER.</h3>


<p>"Nature," remarked James Watt when he
set to work inventing his improved steam-engine,
"has always a weak side if we can
only find it out." Many invaluable secrets
have been successfully explored through the
discovery of Nature's "weak side" since that
momentous era in the industrial history of the
world; and the nineteenth century, as Watt
clearly foresaw, has been emphatically the
age of steam power. In the condenser, the
high pressure cylinder and the automatic cut-off,
which utilises the expansive power of steam
vapour, mankind now possesses the means of
taming a monster whose capacities were almost
entirely unknown to the ancients, and of bringing
it into ready and willing service for the
accomplishment of useful work. Vaguely and
loosely it is often asserted that the age of steam
is now giving place to that of electricity; but
these two cannot yet be logically placed in
opposition to one another. No method has
yet been discovered whereby the heat of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
furnace can be directly converted into an
electric current. The steam-engine or, as
Watt and his predecessors called it, the "fire-engine"
is <i>par excellence</i> the world's prime
motor; and by far the greater proportion of
the electrical energy that is generated to-day
owes its existence primarily to the steam-engine
and to other forms of reciprocating
machinery designed to utilise the expansive
power of vapours or gases acting in a similar
manner to steam.</p>

<p>The industrial revolutions of the coming
century will, without doubt, be brought about
very largely through the utilisation of Nature's
waste energy in the service of mankind. Waterfalls,
after being very largely neglected for
two or three generations, are now commanding
attention as valuable and highly profitable
sources of power. This is only to be regarded
as forming the small beginning of a movement
which, in the coming century, will "acquire
strength by going," and which most probably
will, in less than a hundred years, have produced
changes in the industrial world comparable
to those brought about by the invention
of the steam-engine.</p>

<p>Lord Kelvin, in the year 1881, briefly, but
very significantly, classified the sources of
power available to man under the five primary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
headings of tides, food, fuel, wind, and rain.
Food is the generator of animal energy, fuel
that of the power obtained from steam and
other mechanical expansive engines; rain, as it
falls on the hill-tops and descends in long
lines of natural force to the sea coasts, furnishes
power to the water-wheel; while wind may
be utilised to generate mechanical energy
through the agency of windmills and other
contrivances. The tides as a source of useful
power have hardly yet begun to make their
influence felt, and indeed the possibility of
largely using them is still a matter of doubt.
The relative advantages of reclaiming a given
area of soil for purposes of cultivation, and of
converting the same land into a tidal basin in
order to generate power through the inward
and outward flow of the sea-water, were contrasted
by Lord Kelvin in the statement of
a problem as follows: Which is the more valuable&mdash;an
agricultural area of forty acres or an
available source of energy equal to one hundred
horse-power? The data for the solution of such
a question are obviously not at hand, unless
the quality of the land, its relative nearness to
the position at which power might be required,
and several other factors in its economic application
have been supplied. Still, the fact
remains that very large quantities of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
coastal land and a considerable quantity of
expensive work would be needed for the generation,
by means of the tides, of any really
material quantity of power.</p>

<p>It is strange that, while so much has been written and spoken about
the possibility of turning the energy of the tides to account for
power in the service of man, comparatively little attention has been
paid to the problem of similarly utilising the wave-power, which goes
to waste in such inconceivably huge quantities. Where the tidal force
elevates and depresses the sea-water on a shore, through a vertical
distance of say eight feet, about once in twelve hours, the waves of
the ocean will perform the same work during moderate weather once in
every twelve or fifteen seconds. It is true that the moon in its
attraction of the sea-water produces a vastly greater sum total of
effect than the wind does in raising the surface-waves, but reckoning
only that part of the ocean energy which might conceivably be made
available for service it is safe to calculate that the waves offer
between two and three thousand times as much opportunity for the
capture of natural power and its application to useful work as the tides could
ever present. In no other form is the energy of the wind brought forward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in so small a compass or in so concrete a form. A
steam-ship of 10,000 tons gross weight which rises and falls ten times
per minute through an average height of 3&middot;3 feet is thereby subjected
to an influence equal to 22,400 horse-power. In this estimate the unit
of the horse-power which has been adopted is Watt's arbitrary standard
of "33,000 foot pounds per minute". The work done in raising the
vessel referred to is equal to ten horse-power multiplied by the
number of pounds in a ton, or, in other words, 22,400 horse-power, as
stated.</p>

<p>Wind-power, again, has been to a large extent
neglected since the advent of the steam-engine.
The mightiest work carried out in
any European country in the early part of the
present century was that which the Dutch
people most efficiently performed in the draining
of their reclaimed land by means of scores of
windmills erected along their seaboard. Even
to the present day there are no examples of
the direct employment of the power of the
wind which can be placed in comparison with
those still to be found on the coasts of Holland.
But, unfortunately for the last generation of
windmill builders, the intermittent character
of the power to which they had to trust completely
condemned it when placed in competition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
with the handy and always convenient
steam-engine. The wind bloweth "where it
listeth," but only at such times and seasons
as it listeth, and its vagaries do not suit an
employer whose wages list is mounting up
whether he has his men fully occupied or not.
The storage of power was the great thing
needful to enable the windmill to hold its
own. The electrical storage battery, compressed
air, and other agencies which will
be referred to later on, have now supplied
this want of the windmill builder, but in the
meantime his trade has been to a large extent
destroyed. For its revival there is no doubt
that, as Lord Kelvin remarked in the address
already quoted, "the little thing wanted to let
the thing be done is cheap windmills."</p>

<p>This, however, leads to another part of the
problem. The costliness of the best modern
patterns of windmill as now so extensively
used, particularly in America, is mainly due
to the elaborate, and, on the whole, successful
attempts at minimising the objection of the
intermittent nature of the source of power.
To put the matter in another way, it may be
said that lightness, and sensitiveness to the
slightest breeze, have had to be conjoined with
an eminent degree of safety in the severest
gale, so that the most complicated self-regulating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
mechanisms have been rendered absolutely
imperative. Once the principle of
storage is applied, the whole of the conditions
in this respect are revolutionised. There is
no need to attempt the construction of wind-motors
that shall run lightly in a soft zephyr
of only five or six miles an hour, and stability
is the main desideratum to be looked to.</p>

<p>The fixed windmill, which requires no swivel
mechanism and no vane to keep it up to the
wind, is the cheapest and may be made the
most substantial of all the forms of wind-motor.
In its rudimentary shape this very elementary
windmill resembles a four-bladed screw steam-ship
propeller. The wheel may be constructed
by simply erecting a high windlass with arms
bolted to the barrel at each end, making the
shape of a rectangular cross. But those at
one end are fixed in such positions that when
viewed from the side they bisect the angles
made by those at the other side. Sails of
canvas or galvanised iron are then fastened
to the arms, the position of which is such
that the necessary obliquity to the line of
the barrel is secured at once.</p>

<p>Looking at this elementary and at one time
very popular form of windmill, and asking
ourselves what adaptation its general principle
is susceptible of in order that it may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
usefully employed in conjunction with a
storage battery, we find, at the outset, that,
inasmuch as the electric generator requires a
high speed, there is every inducement to
greatly lengthen the barrel and at the same
time to make the arms of the sails shorter,
because short sails give in the windmill the
high rate of speed required.</p>

<p>We are confronted, in fact, with the same
kind of problem which met the constructors
of turbine steam-engines designed for electric
lighting. The object was to get an initial
speed which would be so great as to admit of
the coupling of the dynamo to the revolving
shaft of the turbine steam-motor, without the
employment of too much reducing gear. In
the case of the wind-motor the eighteenth
century miller was compelled to make the
arms of his mill of gigantic length, so that,
while the centre of the wind pressure on each
arm was travelling at somewhere near to the
rate of the wind, the axis would not be running
too fast and the mill stones would never be
grinding so rapidly as to "set the <i>tems</i>&mdash;or the
lighter parts of the corn&mdash;on fire."</p>

<p>The dynamo for the generation of the
electric current demands exactly the opposite
class of conditions. We may therefore surmise
that the windmill of the future, as constructed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
for the purposes of storing power, will have a
long barrel upon which will be set numerous
very short blades or sails. Reducing this
again to its most convenient form, it is plain
that a spiral of sheet-metal wound round the
barrel will offer the most convenient type of
structure for stability and cheapness combined.
At the end of this long barrel will be fixed
the dynamo, the armature of which is virtually
a part of the barrel itself, while the magnets
are placed in convenient positions on the supporting
uprights. From the generating dynamo
the current is conveyed directly to the storage
batteries, and these alone work the electric
motor, which, if desired, keeps continually in
motion, pumping, grinding, or driving any
suitable class of machinery.</p>

<p>It is rather surprising to find how relatively
small is the advantage possessed by the vane-windmill
over the fixed type in the matter of
continuity of working. During about two
years the Author conducted a series of experiments
with the object of determining this
point, the fixed windmill being applied to
work which rendered it a matter of indifference
in which way the wheel ran. With the
prevailing winds from the west it ran in one
direction, and with those of next degree of
frequency, namely from the east, it turned in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the reverse direction. The mill, however, was
effective although the breeze might veer several
points from either of the locations mentioned.
It was found that there were rather less
than one-fourth of the points of the compass,
the winds from which would bring the wheel
to a standstill or cause it to swing ineffectively,
but as these were the directions in which the
wind least frequently blew it might safely be
reckoned that not one-eighth of the possible
working hours of a swivel-windmill were really
lost in the fixed machine.</p>

<p>With the type adapted to the working of a
dynamo as already described, it will, in most
cases, be convenient to construct two spirals
on uprights set in three holes in the ground,
forming lines at right angles to each other, but
both engaging, by suitable gearing, with the
electric current generator situated at the
angle. This will be found cheaper than to
go to the expense of constructing the mill on
a swivel so that it may follow the direction of
the wind. At the same time it should be
noticed that the adoption of the high speed
wind-wheel, consisting of some kind of spiral
on a very long axis, may be made effective for
improving even the swivel windmill itself, so
as to adapt it for electric generation and conservation
of power through the medium of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
storage battery. Supposing that a number of
small oblique sails be set upon an axis lying in
the direction of the wind, the popular conception
of the result of such an arrangement is
that the foremost sails would render those
behind it almost, if not entirely, useless.</p>

<p>The analogy followed in reaching this conclusion
is that of the sails of a ship, but, as
applied to wind-motors, it is quite misleading,
because not more than one-third or one-fourth
of the energy of the wind is expended upon
the oblique sails of an ordinary wind-wheel.
Moreover, in the case of a number of such
wheels set on a long axis, one behind the other
as described, the space within which the shelter
of the front sail is operative to keep the wind
from driving the next one is exceedingly
minute.</p>

<p>The elasticity of the air and its frictional
inertia when running in the form of wind
cause the current to proceed on its course
after a very slight check, which in point of
time is momentary and in its effects almost
infinitesimal. This being the case, and the
principal expense attendant upon the construction
of ordinary wind-engines being due
to the need for providing a large diameter of
wind-wheel, with all the attendant complications
required to secure such a wheel from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
risk, it is obvious that as soon as the long
axis and the very short sail, or the metallic
spiral, have been generally introduced as adjuncts
to the dynamo storage battery, an era
of cheaper wind-motors will have been entered
upon,&mdash;in fact, the "little want" of which
Lord Kelvin spoke in 1881 will have been
supplied. The high speed which the dynamo
requires, and the more rapid rate at which
windmills constructed on this very economical
principle must necessarily run, both mark the
two classes of apparatus as being eminently
suited for mutual assistance in future usefulness.</p>

<p>The anemometer of the "Robinson" type,
having four little hemispherical cups revolving
horizontally, furnishes the first hint of another
principle of construction adapted to the generation
of electricity. Some years ago a professor
in one of the Scottish Universities set up a
windmill which was simply an amplified anemometer,
and connected it with several of Faure's
storage batteries for the purpose of furnishing
the electric light to his residence. His report
regarding his experience with this arrangement
showed that the results of the system were
quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>In this particular type of natural motor the
wind-wheel, of course, is permanently set to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
run no matter from what direction the wind
may be blowing. Tests instituted with the
object of determining the pressure which the
wind exerts on the cup of a "Robinson"
anemometer have shown that when the breeze
blows into the concave side of the cup, its
effect is rather more than three times as strong
as when it blows against the convex side. At
any given time the principal part of the work
done by a windmill constructed on this principle
is being carried out by one cup which
has its concave side presented to the wind,
while, opposite to it, there is another cup
travelling in the opposite direction to that of
the wind but having its convex side opposed.</p>

<p>The facts that practically only one sail of
the mill is operative at any given time, and
that even the work which is done by this
must be diminished by nearly one-third owing
to the opposing "pull" of the cup at the
opposite side, no doubt must detract from the
merits of such a wind-motor, judged simply
on the basis of actual area of sail employed.
But when the matter of cost alone is taken as
the standard, the advantages are much more
evenly balanced than they might at first sight
seem to be.</p>

<p>The cup-shaped sail may be greatly improved
upon for power-generating purposes by adopting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
a sail having a section not semicircular
but triangular in shape, and by extending its
length in the vertical direction to a very considerable
extent. Practically this cheap and
efficient wind-motor then becomes a square or
hexagonal upright axis of fairly large section,
to each side of which is secured a board or
a rigid sheet-metal sail projecting beyond the
corners. The side of the axis and the projecting
portion of the sail then together form the
triangular section required.</p>

<p>For the sake of safety in time of storm, an
opening may be left at the apex of the angle
which is closed by a door kept shut through
the tension of a spring. When the wind rises
to such a speed as to overbalance the force of
the spring each door opens and lets the blast
pass through. One collateral advantage of
this type of windmill is that it may be made
to act virtually as its own stand, the only
necessity in its erection being that it should
have a collar fitting round the topmost bearing,
which collar is fastened by four strong steel
ropes to stakes securely set in the ground.
The dynamo is then placed at the lower bearing
and protected from the weather by a metal
shield through which the shaft of the axis passes.</p>

<p>For pumping, and for other simple purposes
apart from the use of the dynamo, a ready
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
application of this form of wind-engine with
a minimum of intricacy or expense may be
worked out by setting the lower bearing in a
round tank of water kept in circular motion
by a set of small paddles working horizontally.
Into the water a vertically-working
paddle-wheel dips, carrying on its shaft a crank
which directly drives the pump. This simple
wind-motor is particularly safe in a storm,
because on attaining a high speed it merely
"smashes" the water in the tank.</p>

<p>Solar heat is one of the principal sources of
the energy to be derived from the wind.
Several very determined and ingenious attempts
at the utilisation of the heat of sunshine
for the driving of a motor have been
made during the past century. As a solution
of a mechanical and physical puzzle, the arrangement
of a large reflector, with a small
steam-boiler at the focus of the heat rays
thrown by it, is full of interest. Yet, when a
man like the late John Ericsson, who did so
much to improve the caloric engine, and the
steam-ship as applied to war-like purposes,
meets with failure in the attempt to carry such
an idea to a commercially successful issue,
there is at least <i>prima facie</i> evidence of some
obstacle which places the proposed machine at
a disadvantage in competition with its rivals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
The solar engine, if generally introduced,
would be found more intermittent in its action
than the windmill&mdash;excepting perhaps in a very
few localities where there is a cloudless sky
throughout the year. The windmill gathers up
the power generated by the expansion of the
air in passing over long stretches of heated
ground, while a solar engine cannot command
more of the sun's heat than that which falls
upon the reflector or condenser of the engine
itself. The latter machine may possibly have
a place assigned to it in the industrial economy
of the future, but the sum total of the power
which it will furnish must always be an insignificant
fraction.</p>

<p>The wave-power machine, when allied to
electric transmission, will, without doubt,
supply in a cheap and convenient form a material
proportion of the energy required during
the twentieth century for industrial purposes.
Easy and effective transmission is a <i>sine qu&acirc;
non</i> in this case, just as it is in the utilisation
of waterfalls situated far from the
busy mart and factory. Hardly any natural
source of power presents so near an approach
to constancy as the ocean billows. Shakespeare
takes as his emblem of perpetual motion
the dancing "waves o' th' sea".</p>

<p>But the ocean coasts&mdash;where alone natural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
wave-power is constant&mdash;are exactly the localities
at which, as a rule, it is the least practicable
to build up a manufacturing trade.
Commerce needs smooth water for the havens
offered to its ships, and inasmuch as this
requirement is vastly more imperative during
the early stages of civilisation than cheap power,
the drift of manufacturing centres has been all
towards the calm harbours and away from the
ocean coasts. But electrical transmission in
this connection abolishes space, and can bring
to the service of man the power of the
thundering wave just as it can that of the
roaring torrent or waterfall.</p>

<p>The simplest form of wave-motor may be
suggested by the force exerted by a ferry boat
or dinghy tied up to a pier. The pull exerted
by the rope is equal to the inertia of the boat
as it falls into the trough of each wave successively,
and the amount of strain involved
in rough weather may be estimated from the
thickness of the rope that is generally found
necessary for the security of even very small
craft indeed. A similar suggestion is conveyed
by the need for elaborate "fenders" to break
the force of the shock when a barge is lying
alongside of a steamer, or when any other vessel
is ranging along a pier or jetty.</p>

<p>A buoy of large size, moored in position at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a convenient distance from a rock-bound ocean
coast, will supply the first idea of a wave-motor
on this primary principle as adapted for the
generation of power. On the cliff a high
derrick is erected. Over a pulley or wheel
on the top of this there is passed a wire-rope
cable fastened on the seaward side to the
buoy, and on the landward side to the machinery
in the engine-house. The whole arrangement
in fact is very similar in appearance to
the "poppet-head" and surface buildings that
may be seen at any well-equipped mine. The
difference in principle, of course, is that while
on a mine the engine-house is supplying power
to the other side of the derrick, the relations are
reversed in the wave-motor, the energy being
passed from the sea across into the engine-house.
The reciprocating, or backward and forward,
movement imparted to the cable by the rising
and falling of the buoy now requires to be
converted into a force exerted in one direction.
In the steam-engine and in other machines
of similar type, the problem is simplified
by the uniform length of the stroke made
by the piston, so that devices such as the
crank and eccentric circular discs are readily
applicable to the securing of a rotatory motion
for a fly-wheel from a reciprocating motion
in the cylinders. In the application of wave-power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
provision must be made for the utilisation
of the force derived from movements of
<i>differing lengths</i>, as well as of <i>differing characters</i>,
in the force of impact. Every movement
of the buoy which imparts motion to the pulley
on top of the derrick must be converted into
an additional impetus to a fly-wheel always
running in the same direction.</p>

<p>The spur-wheel and ratchet, as at present
largely used in machinery, offer a rough and
ready means of solving this problem, but
two very important improvements must be
effected before full advantage can be taken
of the principle involved. In the first place
it is obvious that if a ratchet runs freely in
one direction and only catches on the tooth
of the spur-wheel when it is drawn in the
other, the power developed and used is concentrated
on one stroke, when it might,
with greater advantage, be divided between
the two; and in the second place the shock
occasioned by the striking of the ratchet
against the tooth when it just misses catching
one of the teeth and is then forced along the
whole length of the tooth gathering energy
as it goes, must add greatly to the wear and
tear of the machinery and to the unevenness
of the running.</p>

<p>Taking the first of these difficulties into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
consideration it is obvious that by means of
a counterbalancing weight, about equal to
half that of the buoy, it is possible to cause
the wave-power to operate two ratchets, one
doing work when the pull is to landwards
and the other when it is to seawards. Each,
however, must be set to catch the teeth of
its own separate spur-wheel; and, inasmuch
as the direction of the motion in one case is
different from what it is in the other, it is
necessary that, by means of an intervening
toothed wheel, the motion of one of these
should be reversed before it is communicated
to the fly-wheel. The latter is thus driven
always in the same direction, both by the
inward and by the outward stroke or pull
of the cable from the buoy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most convenient development
of the system is that in which the spur-wheel
is driven by two vertically pendant toothed
bands, resembling saws, and of sufficient
length to provide for the greatest possible
amplitude of movement that could be imparted
to them by the motion of the buoy.
The teeth are set to engage in those of the
spur-wheel, one band on each side, so that
the effective stroke in one case is downward,
while in the other it is upward. These
toothed bands are drawn together at their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
lower ends by a spring, and they are also
kept under downward tension by weights or
a powerful spring beneath. The effect of
this is that when both are drawn up and
down the spur-wheel goes round with a
continuous motion, because at every stroke
the teeth of one band engage in the wheel
and control it, while those of the reversed
one (at the other side) slip quite freely.</p>

<p>The shock occasioned by the blow of the
ratchet on the spur-wheel, or of one tooth
upon another, may be reduced almost to
vanishing point by multiplying the number
of ratchets or toothed bands, and placing the
effective ends, which engage in the teeth of
the wheel successively, one very slightly in
advance of the other. In this way the
machine is so arranged that, no matter at
what point the stroke imparted by the movement
of the buoy may be arrested, there is
always one or other of the ratchets or of the
teeth which will fall into engagement with
the tooth of the spur-wheel, very close to its
effective face, and thus the momentum acquired
by the one part before it impinges
upon the other becomes comparatively small.</p>

<p>The limit to which it may be practicable to
multiply ratchets or toothed bands will, of
course, depend upon the thickness of the spur-wheel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and when this latter has been greatly
enlarged, with the object of providing for this
feature, it becomes virtually a steel drum having
bevelled steps accurately cut longitudinally
upon its periphery.</p>

<p>The masts of a ship tend to assume a position
at right angles to the water-line. When
the waves catch the vessel on the beam the
greatest degree of pendulous swing is brought
about in a series of waves so timed, and of
such a length, that the duration of the swing
coincides with the period required for one wave
to succeed another. The increasing slope of
the ship's decks, due to the inertia of this continuous
rhythmical motion, often amounts to
far more than the angle made by the declivity
of the wave as compared with the sea level;
and it is, of course, a source of serious danger
in the eyes of the mariner.</p>

<p>But, for the purposes of the mechanician
who desires to secure power from the waves,
the problem is not how to avoid a pendulous
motion but how to increase it. For each
locality in which any large wave-power plant
of machinery is to be installed, it will therefore
be advisable to study the characteristic
length of the wave, which, as observation has
proved, is shorter in confined seas than in
those fully open to the ocean. It is advisable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
then to make the beam width of the buoy, no
matter how it may be turned, of such a length
that when one side is well in the trough of a
wave the other must be not far from the crest.</p>

<p>Practically the best design for such a floating
power-generator will be one in which four
buoys are placed, each of them at the end of
one arm of a cross which has been braced up
very firmly. From the angle of intersection
projects a vertical mast, also firmly held by
stays or guys. The whole must be anchored
to the bottom of the sea by attachment to a
large cemented block or other heavy weight
having a ring let into it, from which is attached
a chain of a few links connecting with
an upright beam. It is the continuation of
the latter above sea-level which forms the
mast. On this beam the framework of the
buoy must be free to move up and down.</p>

<p>At first sight it might seem as if this arrangement
rendered nugatory the attempt to
take advantage of the rise and fall of the
buoy; but it is not so when the relations of
the four buoys to one another are considered.
Although the frame is free to move up and
down upon the uprising shaft, still its inclination
to the vertical is determined by the direction
of the line drawn from a buoy in the
trough of a wave to one on the crest. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
order to facilitate the free movement, and to
render the rocking effect more accurate and
free from vibration, sets of wheels running on
rails fixed to the beam are of considerable
advantage.</p>

<p>The rise and fall of the tides render necessary
the adoption of some such compensating
device as that which has been indicated. Of
course it would be possible to provide for utilising
the force generated by a buoy simply
moored direct to a ring at the bottom by means
of a common chain cable; but this latter would
require to be of a length sufficient to provide
for the highest possible wave on the top of the
highest tide. Then, again, the loose chain at
low tide would permit the buoy to drift abroad
within a very considerable area of sea surface,
and in order to take advantage of the rise and
fall on each wave it would be essential to provide
at the derrick on the shore end of the
wave-power plant very long toothed bands
or equivalent devices on a similarly enlarged
scale.</p>

<p>By providing three or four chains and moorings,
meeting in a centre at the buoy itself
but fastened to rings secured to weights at
the bottom at a considerable distance apart,
the lateral movement might, no doubt, be
minimised; and for very simple installations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
this plan, associated with the device of taking
a cable from the buoy and turning it several
times round a drum on shore, could be used
to furnish a convenient source of cheap power.
The drum may carry a crank and shaft, which
works the spur-wheel and toothed bands as
already described, so that no matter at what
stage in the revolution of the drum an upward
or downward stroke may be stopped, the
motion will still be communicated in a continuous
rotary form to the fly-wheel.</p>

<p>But the beam and sliding frame, with buoys,
give the best practical results, especially for
large installations. It is in some instances
advisable, especially where the depth of the
water at a convenient distance from the shore
is very considerable, not to provide a single
beam reaching the whole distance to the bottom,
but to anchor an air-tight tank below the surface
and well beneath the depth at which wave
disturbance is ever felt. From this submerged
tank, which approximately keeps a steady
position in all tides and weathers, the upward
beam is attached by a ring just as would be
done if the tank itself constituted the bottom.</p>

<p>One main reason for this arrangement is
that the resistance of the beam to the water
as it rocks backwards and forwards wastes to
some extent the power generated by the force
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of the waves; and the greater the length of
the beam, the longer must be the distance
through which it has to travel when the buoys
draw it into positions vertical to that of the
framework. A thin steel pipe offers less resistance
than a wooden beam of equal strength,
besides facilitating the use of a simple device
for enabling the frame and buoys to slide
easily up and down.</p>

<p>The generally fatal defect of those inventions
which have been designed in the past with
the object of utilising wave-power has arisen
from the mistake of placing too much of the
machinery in the sea. The device of erecting
in the water an adjustable reservoir to catch
the wave crests and to use the power derived
from them as the water escaped through a
water-wheel was patented in 1869. Nearly
twenty years later another scheme was brought
out depending upon the working of a large
pump fixed far under the surface, and connected
with the shore so that, when operated
by the rising and falling of floats upon the
waves, it would drive a supply of water into
an elevated reservoir on shore, from which,
on escaping down the cliff, the pressure of
the water would be utilised to work a turbine.</p>

<p>Earlier devices included the building of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
mill upon a rocking barge, having weights and
pulleys adjusted to run the machinery on
board; and also a revolving float so constructed
that each successive wave would
turn one portion, but the latter would then
be held firm by a toothed wheel and ratchet
until another impulse would be given to it
in the same direction. This plan included
certain elements of the simple system already
described; but it is obvious that some of its
floating parts might with advantage have been
removed to the shore end, where they would
not only be available for ready inspection and
adjustment, but also be out of harm's way in
rough weather.</p>

<p>Different wave-lengths, as already explained,
correspond to various periods in the pendulous
swing of floating bodies. Examples have
been cited by Mr. Vaughan Cornish, M. Sc., in
<i>Knowledge</i>, 2nd March, 1896, as follows: "A
wave-length of fifty feet corresponds to a period
of two and a half seconds, while one of 310
feet corresponds to five and a half seconds.
It is mentioned that the swing of the steam-ship
<i>Great Eastern</i> took six seconds." Other
authorities state that during a storm in the
Atlantic the velocity of the wave was determined
to be thirty-two miles an hour, and
that nine or ten waves were included in each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
mile; thus about five would pass in each
minute. But in average weather the number
of waves to the mile is considerably larger,
say, from fifteen to twenty to the mile; and
in nearly calm days about double those
numbers.</p>

<p>One interesting fact, which gives to wave-power
a peculiarly enhanced value as a source
of stored wind-power, is that the surface of
the ocean&mdash;wild as it may at times appear&mdash;is
not moved by such extremes of agitation
as the atmosphere. In a calm it is never so
inertly still, and in a storm it is never so far
beyond the normal condition in its agitation
as is the wind. The ocean surface to some
extent operates as the governor of a steam-engine,
checking an excess in either direction.
In very moderate weather the number of
waves to the mile is greatly increased, while
their speed is not very much diminished.
Indeed the rate at which they travel may
even be increased.</p>

<p>This latter phenomenon generally occurs
when long ocean rollers pass out of a region
of high wind into one of relative calm, the
energy remaining for a long time comparatively
constant by reason of the multiplication
of short, low waves created out of long, high
ones. On all ocean coasts the normal condition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of the surface is governed by this law,
and it follows that, no matter what the local
weather may be at any given time, there is
always plenty of power available.</p>

<p>An attempt was made by M. C. Antoine,
after a long series of observations, to establish
a general relation between the speed of the
wind and that of the waves caused by it, the
formul&aelig; being published in the <i>Revue Nautique
et Coloniale</i> in 1879. The rule may
be taken as correct within certain limits,
although in calm weather, when the condition
of the ocean surface is almost entirely
ruled by distant disturbances, it has but little
relevancy. Approximately, the velocity of
wave transmission is seven times the fourth
root of the wind-speed; so that when the
latter is a brisk breeze of sixteen miles an
hour the waves will be travelling fourteen
miles an hour, or very nearly as fast as the
wind. When, on the other hand, a light breeze
of nine miles an hour is driving the waves, the
latter, according to the formula, should run
about twelve and a half miles an hour; but, in
point of fact, the influence of more distant
commotion nearly always interferes with this
result.</p>

<p>As a matter of experience, the waves on an
ocean coast are usually running faster than the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
wind, and, being so much more numerous in
calm than they are in rough weather, they
maintain comparatively a uniform sum total
of energy. It is obvious that, so far as practical
purposes are concerned, three waves of an
available height of three feet each are as effective
as one of nine feet. If the state of the weather
be such that the average wave length is 176
feet there will be exactly thirty waves to the
mile, and if the speed be twelve miles an
hour&mdash;that is to say, if an expanse of twelve
miles of waves pass a given point hourly&mdash;then
360 waves will pass every sixty minutes, or six
every minute. In the wave-power plant as
described, each buoy of one hundred tons displacement
when raised and depressed, say,
three feet by every wave will thus be capable
of giving power equal to three times 600, or
1,800 foot-tons per minute.</p>

<p>The unit of nominal horse-power being
33,000 foot-pounds or about fifteen foot-tons
per minute, it is evident that each buoy, at
its maximum, would be capable of giving
about 120 horse-power. Supposing that half
of the possible energy were exerted at the
forward and half at the backward stroke and
that each buoy were always in position to
exert its full power upon the uprising shaft
without deduction, the total effective duty of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a machine such as has been described would
be 480 horse-power. In practice, however, the
available duty would probably, according to
minor circumstances, be rather more or rather
less than 300 horse-power.</p>

<h3>STORAGE OF POWER.</h3>


<p>The three principal forms of stored power which are now in sight above
the horizon of the industrial outlook are the electric storage
battery, compressed air, and calcium-carbide. The first of these has
come largely into use owing to the demand for a regulated and stored
supply of electricity available for lighting purposes. Indeed the
storage battery has practically rendered safe the wide introduction of
electric lighting, because a number of cells, when once charged, are
always available as a reserve in case of any failure in the power or
in the generators at any central station; and also because, by means
of the storage cells or "accumulators," the amount of available
electrical energy can be subdivided into different and subordinate
circuits, thus obviating the necessity for the employment of currents
of very high voltage and eluding the only imperfectly-solved problem
of dividing a current traversing a wire as conveniently as lighting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
gas is divided by taking small pipes off from the gas mains.</p>

<p>Compressed air for the storage of power
has hitherto been best appreciated in mining
operations, one of the main reasons for this
being that the liberated air itself&mdash;apart from
the power which it conveyed and stored&mdash;has
been so great a boon to the miner working in
ill-ventilated stopes and drives. The cooling
effects of the expansion, after close compression,
are also very grateful to men labouring
hard at very great depths, where the heat from
the country rock would become, in the absence
of such artificial refrigeration, almost overpowering.
For underground railway traffic
exactly the same recommendations have, at one
period during the fourth quarter of the nineteenth
century, given an adventitious stimulus
to the use of compressed air.</p>

<p>Yet it is now undoubted that, even in deep
mining, the engineer's best policy is to adopt
different methods for the conveyance and
storage of power on the one hand, and for
the ventilation of the workings on the other.
Few temptations are more illusory in the course
of industrial progress than those presented by
that class of inventions which aim at "killing
two birds with one stone". If one object be
successfully accomplished it almost invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
happens that the other is indifferently carried
out; but the most frequent result is that both
of them suffer in the attempt to adapt machinery
to irreconcilable purposes.</p>

<p>The electric rock-drill is now winning its
way into the mines which are ventilated with
comparative ease as well as into those which
are more difficult to supply with air. It is
plain, therefore, that on its merits as a conveyer
and storer of power the electric current
is preferable to compressed air. The heat
that is generated and then dissipated in the
compression of any gas for such a purpose
represents a very serious loss of power; and
it is altogether an insufficient excuse to point
to the compensation of coolness being secured
from the expansion. Fans driven by electric
motors already offer a better solution of the
ventilation difficulty, and the advantages on
this side are certain to increase rather than to
diminish during the next few years.</p>

<p>The electric rock-drill, which can already
hold its own with that driven by compressed
air, is therefore bound to gain ground in the
future. This is a type and indication of what
will happen all along the industrial line, the
electric current taking the place of the majority
of other means adopted for the transmission
of power. Even in workshops&mdash;where it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
important to have a wide distribution of power
and each man must be able to turn on a supply
of it to his bench at any moment&mdash;shafting is
being displaced by electric cables for the conveyance
of power to numerous small motors.</p>

<p>The loss of power in this system has already
been reduced to less than that which occurs
with shafting, unless under the most favourable
circumstances; and in places where the works
are necessarily distributed over a considerable
area the advantage is so pronounced that hardly
any factories of that kind will be erected ten
years hence without resort being had to electricity,
and small motors as the means of distributing
the requisite supplies of power to the spots
where they are needed. It was a significant
fact that at the Paris Exposition of 1900 the
electric system of distribution was adopted.</p>

<p>In regard to compressed air, however, it
seems practically certain that, notwithstanding
its inferiority to electric storage of power, it is
applicable to so many kinds of small and cheap
installations that, on the whole, its area of
usefulness, instead of being restricted, will be
largely increased in the near future. There
will be an advance all along the line; and
although electric storage will far outstrip
compressed air for the purposes of the large
manufacturer, the air reservoir will prove
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
highly useful in isolated situations, and particularly
for agricultural work.</p>

<p>For example, as an adjunct to the ordinary
rural windmill for pumping water, it will prove
much more handy and effective than the system
at present in vogue of keeping large tanks on
hand for the purpose of ensuring a supply of
water during periods of calm weather. Regarding
a tank of water elevated above the
ground and filled from a well as representing so
much stored energy, and also comparing this
with an equal bulk of air compressed to about
300 pounds pressure to the square inch, it
would be easy to show that&mdash;unless the water
has been pumped from a very deep well&mdash;the
power which its elevation indicates must be
only a small fraction of that enclosed in the
air reservoir.</p>

<p>It will be one great point in favour of compressed
air, as a form of stored energy for the
special purpose of pumping, that by making
a continuous small flow of air take the place
of the water at the lowest level in the upward
pipe, it is possible to cause it to do the pumping
without the intervention of any motor.</p>

<p>One means of effecting this may be simply
indicated. The air under pressure is admitted
from a very small air pipe and the bubbles, as
they rise, fill the hollow of an inverted iron
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
cup rising and falling on a bearing like a hinge.
Above and beneath the chamber containing
this cup are valves opening upwards and similar
to those of an ordinary force or suction
pump. The cup must be weighted with adjustable
weights so that it will not rise until quite
full of air. When that point is reached the
stroke is completed, the air having driven
upwards a quantity of water of equal bulk
with itself, and, as the cup falls again by its
own weight, the vacuum caused by the air
escaping upwards through the pipe is filled by
an inrush of water through the lower valve.
The function of the upper valve, at that time,
is to keep the water in the pipe from falling
when the pressure on the column is removed.
The expansive power of the air enables it to
do more lifting at the upper than at the lower
level, so that a larger diameter of pipe can be
used at the former place.</p>

<p>Cheap motors working on the same principle&mdash;that
is to say through the upward escape of
compressed air, gas or vapour filling a cup
and operating it by its buoyancy, or turning a
wheel in a similar manner&mdash;will doubtless be
a feature in the machine work of the future;
and for motors of this description it is obvious
that compressed air will be very useful as the
form of power-storage. Excepting under very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
special conditions, steam is not available for
such a purpose, seeing that it condenses long
before it has risen any material distance in a
column of cold water.</p>

<p>"The present accumulator," remarked Prof.
Sylvanus P. Thompson in the year 1881, referring
to the Faure storage batteries then in use,
"probably bears as much resemblance to the
future accumulator as a glass bell-jar used in
chemical experiments for holding gas does to
the gasometer of a city gasworks, or James
Watt's first model steam-engine does to the
engines of an Atlantic steamer." When Faure,
having in 1880 improved upon the storage
battery of Plant&eacute;, sent his four-cell battery
from Paris to Glasgow, carrying in it stored
electrical energy, it was found to contain
power equal to close upon a million foot-pounds,
which is about the work done by a
horse-power during the space of half an hour.
This battery weighed very nearly 75 lb. It
nevertheless represented an immense forward
step in the problem of compressing a given
quantity of potential power into a small weight
of accumulator.</p>

<p>The progress made during less than twenty
years to the end of the century may be estimated
from the conditions laid down by the
Automobile Club of Paris for the competitive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
test of accumulators applicable to auto-car
purposes in 1899. It was stipulated that five
cells, weighing in all 244 lb., should give out
120 ampere-hours of electric intensity; and
that at the conclusion of the test there should
remain a voltage of 1&middot;7 volt per cell.</p>

<p>Very great improvements in the construction
of electric accumulators are to be looked for
in the near future. Hitherto the average
duration of the life of a storage cell has not
been more than about two years; and where
impurities have been present in the sulphuric
acid, or in the litharge or "minium" employed,
the term of durability has been still further
shortened. It must be remembered that while
the principal chemical and electrical action in
the cell is a circular one,&mdash;that is to say, the
plates and liquids get back to the original
condition from which they started when beginning
work in a given period,&mdash;there is also a
progressive minor action depending upon the
impurities that may be present. Such a reagent,
for instance, as nitric acid has an
extremely injurious effect upon the plates.</p>

<p>During the first decade after Plant&eacute; and
Faure had made their original discoveries, the
main drawback to the advancement of the
electric accumulator for the storage of power
owed its existence to the lack of precise knowledge,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
among those placed in charge of storage
batteries, as to the destructive effects of impurities
in the cells. It is, however, now the
rule that all acids and all samples of water
used for the purpose must be carefully tested
before adoption, and this practice, in itself,
has greatly prolonged the average life of the
accumulator cell.</p>

<p>The era of the large electric accumulator of
the kind foreshadowed by Prof. Sylvanus P.
Thompson has not yet arrived, the simple
reason being that electric power storage&mdash;apart
from the special purposes of the subdivision
and transmission for lighting&mdash;has not yet
been tried on a large scale. For the regulation
and graduation of power it is exceedingly
handy to be able to "switch-on" a number of
small accumulator cells for any particular purpose;
and, of course, the degree of control
held in the hands of the engineer must depend
largely on the smallness of each individual
cell, and the number which he has at command.
This fact of itself tends to keep down the size
of the storage cell which is most popular.</p>

<p>But when power storage by means of the
electric accumulator really begins in earnest
the cells will attain to what would at present
be regarded as mammoth proportions; and the
special purpose aimed at in each instance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
power installation will be the securing of continuity
in the working of a machine depending
upon some intermittent natural force. Windmills
are especially marked out as the engines
which will be used to put electrical energy into
the accumulators. From these latter again the
power will be given out and conveyed to a
distance continuously.</p>

<p>High ridges and eminences of all kinds
will in the future be selected as the sites of
wind-power and accumulator plants. In the
eighteenth century, when the corn from the
wheat-field required to be ground into flour by
the agency of wind-power, it was customary
to build the mill on the top of some high hill
and to cart all the material laboriously to the
eminence. In the installations of the future
the power will be brought to the material rather
than the material to the power. From the
ranges or mountain peaks, and also from
smaller hills, will radiate electrical power-nerves
branching out into network on the
plains and supplying power for almost every
purpose to which man applies physical force
or electro-chemical energy.</p>

<p>The gas-engine during the twentieth century
will vigorously dispute the field against electrical
storage; and its success in the struggle&mdash;so far
as regards its own particular province&mdash;will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
enhanced owing to the fact that, in some respects,
it will be able to command the services
of electricity as its handmaid. Gas-engines are
already very largely used as the actuators of
electric lighting machinery. But in the developments
which are now foreshadowed by
the advent of acetylene gas the relation will
be reversed. In other words, the gas-engine
will owe its supply of cheap fuel to the electric
current derived at small expense from natural
sources of power.</p>

<p>Calcium carbide, by means of which acetylene
gas is obtained as a product from water,
becomes in this view stored power. The marvellously
cheap "water-gas" which is made
through a jet of steam impinging upon incandescent
carbons or upon other suitable
glowing hot materials will, no doubt, for a
long time command the market after the date
at which coal-gas for the generation of power
has been partially superseded.</p>

<p>But it seems exceedingly probable that a
compromise will ultimately be effected between
the methods adopted for making water-gas
and calcium carbide respectively, the electric
current being employed to keep the carbons
incandescent. When power is to be sold in
concrete form it will be made up as calcium
carbide, so that it can be conveyed to any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
place where it is required without the assistance
of either pipes or wires. But when the
laying of the latter is practicable&mdash;as it will
be in the majority of instances&mdash;the gas for
an engine will be obtainable without the need
for forcing lime to combine with carbon as in
calcium carbide.</p>

<p>Petroleum oil is estimated to supply power
at just one-third the price of acetylene gas
made with calcium carbide at a price of &pound;20 per
ton. This calculation was drawn up before the
occurrence of the material rise in the price of
"petrol" in the last year of the nineteenth
century; while, concurrently, the price of calcium
carbide was falling. A similar process
will, on the average, be maintained throughout
each decade; and, as larger plants, with cheaper
natural sources of energy, are brought into
requisition, the costs of power, as obtained
from oil and from acetylene gas, will more and
more closely approximate, until, in course of
time, they will be about equal; after which,
no doubt, the relative positions will be reversed,
although not perhaps in the same ratio. Time
is all on the side of the agent which depends
for its cheapness of production on the utilisation
of any natural source of power which is
free of all cost save interest, wear and tear, and
supervision.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Even the steam-engine itself is not exempt
from the operation of the general law placing
the growing advantage on the side of power
that is obtainable gratis. One cubic inch of
water converted into steam and at boiling
point will raise a ton weight to the height of
one foot; and the quantity of coal of good
quality needed for the transformation of the
water is very small. One pound of good coal
will evaporate nine pounds of water, equal to
about 250 cubic inches, this doing 250 foot-tons
of work. But Niagara performs the
same amount of work at infinitely less cost.
However small any quantity may be, its ratio
to nothing is infinity.</p>

<p>It has been the custom during the nineteenth
century to institute comparisons between the
marvellous economy of steam power and the
expensive wastefulness of human muscular
effort. For instance, the full day's work of
an Eastern porter, specially trained to carry
heavy weights, will generally amount to the
removal of a load of from three to five hundred-weight
for a distance of one mile; but
such a labourer in the course of a long day
has only expended as much power as would
be stored up in about five ounces of coal.</p>

<p>Still the fact remains that one of the greatest
problems of the future is that which concerns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the reduction in the cost of power. Hundreds
of millions of the human race pass lives of a
kind of dull monotonous toil which develops
only the muscular, at the expense of the higher,
faculties of the body; they are almost entirely
cut off from social intercourse with their fellow-men,
and they sink prematurely into decrepitude
simply by reason of the lack of a cheap
and abundant supply of mechanical power,
ready at hand wherever it is wanted. Scores
of "enterprises of great pith and moment" in
the industrial advancement of the world have
to be abandoned by reason of the same lack.
In mining, in agriculture, in transport and in
manufacture the thing that is needful to convert
the "human machine" into a more or less
intelligent brainworker is cheaper power. All
the technical education in the world will not
avail to raise the labourer in the intellectual
scale if his daily work be only such as a horse
or an engine might perform.</p>

<p>The transmission of power through the medium of the electric
current will naturally attain its first great development in the
neighbourhoods of large waterfalls such as Niagara. When the
manufacturers within a short radius of the source of power in each
case have begun to fully reap the benefit due to cheap power,
competition will assert itself in many different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
ways. The values of real property will rise, and population will
tend to become congested within the localities' served.</p>

<p>It will be found, however, that facilities for
shipment will to a large extent perpetuate the
advantage at present held by manufactories
situated on ports and harbours; and this, of
course, will apply with peculiar force to the
cases of articles of considerable bulk. Where
a very great deal of power is needed for the
making of an article or material of comparatively
small weight and bulk proportioned to
its value&mdash;such for instance as calcium carbide
or aluminium&mdash;the immediate vicinity of the
source of natural power will offer superlative
inducements. But an immense number of
things lie between the domains of these two
classes, and for the economical manufacture
of these it is imperative that both cheap power
and low wharfage rates should be obtainable.</p>

<p>An increasingly intense demand must thus
spring up for systems of long distance transmission,
and very high voltage will be adopted
as the means of diminishing the loss of power
due to leakage from the cables. Similarly the
"polyphase" system&mdash;which is eminently
adapted to installations of the nature indicated&mdash;must
demand increasing attention.</p>

<p>Taking a concrete example, mention may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
made of the effects to be expected from the
proposed scheme for diverting some of the
headwaters of the Tay and its lakes from
the eastern to the western shores of Scotland
and establishing at Loch Leven&mdash;the western
inlet, not the inland lake of that name&mdash;a seaport
town devoted to manufacturing purposes
requiring very cheap supplies of power. It is
obvious that the owners of mills in and around
Glasgow, and only forty or fifty miles distant,
will make the most strenuous exertions to
enable them to secure a similar advantage.</p>

<p>It is already claimed that with the use of
currents of high voltage for carrying the power,
and "step-down transformers" converting these
into a suitable medium for the driving of
machinery, a fairly economical transmission
can be ensured along a distance of 100 miles.
It therefore seems plain that the natural forces
derived from such sources as waterfalls can
safely be reckoned upon as friends rather than
as foes of the vested interests of all the great
cities of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The possibilities of long distance transmission
are greatly enhanced by the very recent
discovery that a cable carrying a current
of high voltage can be most effectually insulated
by encasing it in the midst of a tube
filled with wet sawdust and kept at a low
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
temperature, preferably at the freezing point
of water.</p>

<p>Wireless transmission of a small amount of
power has been proved to be experimentally
possible. In the rarefied atmosphere at a
height of five or ten miles from the earth's
surface, electric discharges of very high voltage
are conveyed without any other conducting
medium than that of the air. By sending up
balloons, carrying suspended wires, the positions
of despatch and of receipt can be so elevated
that the resistance of the atmosphere can be
almost indefinitely diminished. In this way
small motors have been worked by discharges
generated at considerable distances, and absolutely
without the existence of any connection
by metallic conductors. Possibilities of the
exportation of power from suitable stations&mdash;such
as the neighbourhoods of waterfalls&mdash;and
its transmission for distances of hundreds or
even thousands of miles have been spoken of
in relation to the industrial prospects of the
twentieth century.</p>

<p>Comparing any such hypothetical system
with that of sending power along good metallic
conductors, there is at once apparent a very
serious objection in the needless dispersion of
energy throughout space in every direction.
If a power generator by wireless transmission,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
without any metallic connection, can work one
motor at a distance of, say, 1,000 miles, then
it can also operate millions of similar possible
motors situated at the same distance; and by
far the greater part of its electro-motive force
must be wasted in upward dispersion.</p>

<p>The analogy of the wireless transmitter of
intelligence may be misleading if applied to the
question of power. The practicability of wireless
telegraphy depends upon the marvellous
susceptibility of the "coherer," which enables
it to respond to an impulse almost infinitesimally
small, certainly very much smaller
than that despatched by the generator from
the receiving station. From this it follows,
as already stated, that the analogy of apparatus
designed merely for the despatch of intelligence
by signalling cannot safely be applied to
the case of the transmission of energy.</p>

<p>Making all due allowances for the prospects
of advance in minimising the resistance of
the atmosphere, it must nevertheless be remembered
that any wireless system will be
called upon to compete with improved means
of conveying the electric current along metallic
circuits. Electrical science, moreover, is only
at the commencement of its work in economising
the cost of power-cables.</p>

<p>The invention by which one wire can be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
used to convey the return current of two cables
very much larger in sectional area is only one
instance in point. The two major cables carry
currents running in opposite directions, and as
these currents are both caused to return along
the third and smaller wire their electro-motive
forces balance one another, with the result that
the return wire needs only to carry a small
difference-current. The return wire, in fact,
is analogous to the Banking Clearing House,
which deals with balances only, and which
therefore can sometimes adjust business to
the value of many millions with payments of
only a few thousands. Later on it may fairly
be expected that duplicate and quadruplicate
telegraphy will find its counterpart in systems
by which different series of electrical impulses
of high voltage will run along a wire, the one
alternating with the other and each series
filling up the gaps left between the others.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ARTIFICIAL POWER.</h3>


<p>The steam-turbine is the most clearly visible
of the revolutionary agencies in motors using
the artificial sources of power. In the first
attempts to introduce the principle the false
analogy of the water-turbine gave rise to much
waste of inventive energy and of money; but
the more recent and more distinctly successful
types of machine have been constructed with
a clear understanding that the windmill is the
true precursor of the steam-turbine. It is
clearly perceived that, although it may be
convenient and even essential to reduce the
arms to pigmy dimensions and to enclose them
in a tube, still the general principle of the
machine must resemble that of a number of
wind motors all running on the same shaft.</p>

<p>It has been proved, moreover, that this
multiplicity of minute wheels and arms has a
very distinct advantage in that it renders
possible the utilisation of the expansive power
of steam. The first impact is small in area
but intense in force, while those arms which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
receive the expanded steam further on are
larger in size as suited to making the best use
of a weaker force distributed over a greater
amount of space.</p>

<p>The enormous speed at which steam under
heavy pressure rushes out of an orifice was
not duly appreciated by the first experimenters
in this direction. To obtain the best results
in utilising the power from escaping steam
there must be a certain definite proportion
between the speed of the vapour and that of
the vane or arm against which it strikes. In
other words, the latter must not "smash" the
jet, but must run along with it. In the case
of the windmill the ratio has been stated approximately
by the generalisation that the
velocity of the tips of the sails is about two
and a half times that of the wind. This refers
to the old style of windmill as used for grinding
corn.</p>

<p>The steam turbine must, therefore, be
essentially a motor of very great initial speed;
and the efforts of recent inventors have been
wisely directed in the first instance to the
object of applying it to those purposes for
which machinery could be coupled up to the
motor with little, if any, necessity for slowing
down the motion through such appliances as
belting, toothed wheels, or other forms of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
intermediate gearing. The dynamo for electric
lighting naturally first suggested itself; but
even in this application it was found necessary
to adopt a rate of speed considerably lower
than that which the steam imparts to the
turbine; and, unfortunately, it is exactly in
the arrangement of the gear for the first slowing-down
that the main difficulty comes in.</p>

<p>Nearly parallel is the case of the cream
separator, to which the steam-turbine principle
has been applied with a certain degree of
success. By means of fine flexible steel shafts
running in bearings swathed in oil it has been
found possible to utilise the comparatively
feeble force of a small steam jet operating at
immense speed to produce one of much slower
rate but enormously greater strength. Some
success has been achieved also in using the
principle not only for cream separators, which
require a comparatively high velocity, but for
other purposes connected with the rural and
manufacturing industries.</p>

<p>An immense forward stride, however, was
made when the idea was first conceived of a
steam-turbine and a water-turbine being fixed
on the same shaft and the latter being used
for the propulsion of a vessel at sea. In this
case it is obvious that, by a suitable adjustment
of the pitch of screw adopted in both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
cases, a nice mathematical agreement between
the vapour power and the liquid application
of that power can be ensured.</p>

<p>All previous records of speed have been
eclipsed by the turbine-driven steamers engined
on this principle. Through the abolition of
the principal causes of excessive vibration&mdash;which
renders dangerous the enlargement of
marine reciprocating engines beyond a certain
size&mdash;the final limit of possible speed has been
indefinitely extended. The comfort of the
passenger, equally with the safety of the hull,
demands the diminution of the vibration nuisance
in modern steamships, and whether the
first attempts to cater for the need by turbine-engines
be fully successful or not, there is no
doubt whatever that the fast mail packets of
the future will be driven by steam-engines
constructed on a system in which the turbine
principle will form an important part.</p>

<p>Further applications will soon follow. It is clear that if the
steam-turbine can be advantageously used for the driving of a vessel
through the water, then, conversely, it can be similarly applied to
the creation of a current of water or of any other suitable liquid.
This liquid-current, again, is applicable to the driving of machinery
at any rate that may be desired. In this view the slowing-down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
process, which involves elaborate and delicate machinery when
accomplished in the purely mechanical method, can be much more
economically effected through the friction of fluid particles.</p>

<p>One method of achieving this object is an
arrangement in which the escaping steam
drives a turbine-shaft running through a long
tube and passing into the water in a circular
tank, in which, again, the shaft carries a spiral
or turbine screw for propelling the water.
The arrangement, it will be seen, is strictly
analogous to that of the steam-turbine as
used in marine propulsion, the shaft passing
through the side of the tank just as it does
through the stern of the vessel.</p>

<p>One essential point, however, is that the
line of the shaft must not pass through the
centre of the circular tank, but must form the
chord of an arc, so that when the water is
driven against the side by the revolution of
the screw it acts like a tangential jet. Practically
the water is thus kept in motion just as
it would be if a hose with a strong jet of
water were inserted and caused to play at an
obtuse angle against the inner side.</p>

<p>Motion having been imparted to the fluid in
the tank, a simple device such as a paddle-wheel
immersed at its lower end, may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
adopted for taking up the power and passing
it on to the machinery required to be actuated.
By setting both the shaft carrying the vanes
for the steam-turbine and the screw for the
propulsion of the water at a downward inclination
it becomes practicable to drive the fluid
without requiring any hole in the tank; and
in this case the latter may be shaped in annular
form and pivoted so that it becomes a
horizontal fly-wheel. Obstructing projections
on the inside periphery of the annular tank
assist the water to carry the latter along with
it in its circular motion.</p>

<p>For small steam motors, particularly for
agricultural and domestic purposes, the turbine
principle is destined to render services of
the utmost importance. The prospect of its
extremely economical construction depends
largely upon the fact that, with the exception
of two or three very small bearings carrying
narrow shafts, it contains no parts demanding
the same fine finish as does the cylinder of
a reciprocating engine. It solves in a very
simple manner the much-vexed problem of the
rotary engine, upon which so much ingenuity
has been fruitlessly exercised. The steam-turbine
also has shown that, for taking advantage
of the generation and the expansive power
of steam, there is no absolute necessity for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
including a steam-tight chamber with moving
parts in the machine.</p>

<p>For very small motors suitable for working
fans and working other household appliances,
the use of a jet of steam, applied directly to
drive a small annular fly-wheel filled with
mercury&mdash;without the intervention of any
turbine&mdash;will no doubt prove handy. But in
the economy of the future such appliances
will take the place of electrical machinery
only in exceptional situations.</p>

<p>One promising use of the turbine or steam-jet&mdash;used
to propel a fly-wheel filled with
liquid as described&mdash;has for its object the
supply of the electric light in country houses.
In this case the fly-wheel is fitted, on its
lower side, to act as the armature of a
dynamo, and the magnets are placed horizontally
around it.</p>

<p>The full effective power from a jet of steam
is not communicated to a dynamo for electric
lighting or other purposes unless there be a
definite ratio between the speeds of the turbine
and of the armature respectively. This may
be conveniently provided for, with more precision
and in a less elaborate way than that
which has just been described, if the steam
jet be made to drive a vertically pendant
turbine, the lower extremity of which, carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
very small horizontal paddles, must be
inserted into the centre of a circular tank.</p>

<p>The principle upon which the reduction of
speed necessary for the dynamo is then effected
depends upon the fact that in a whirlpool the
liquid near the centre runs nearly as fast as
that on the outer periphery, and therefore&mdash;the
circles being so very much smaller&mdash;the number
of revolutions effected in a given time is much
greater. Thus a steam jet turning a pendant
turbine&mdash;dipping into the middle of the whirlpool
and carrying paddles&mdash;at an enormously
high speed may be made to impart motion to
the water in a circular tank (or, if desired, to
the tank itself) at a very much slower rate;
the amount of the reduction, of course, depending
mainly on the ratio between the diameter
of the tank and the length of the small paddles
at the centre setting the liquid in motion.</p>

<p>For special purposes it is best to substitute
a spherical for an ordinary circular tank and
the size may be greatly diminished by using
mercury instead of water. The sphere is complete,
excepting for a small aperture at the
top for the admission of the steel shaft of the
steam-driven turbine. No matter how high
may be the speed, the liquid cannot be thrown
out from a spherical revolving receptacle constructed
in this way. Moreover, the mercury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
acts not only as a transmitter of the power
from the turbine to the purpose for which it
is wanted, but also as a governor. Whenever
the speed becomes so great as to throw the
liquid entirely into the sides of the sphere&mdash;so
that the shaft and paddles are running free
of contact with it in the middle&mdash;the machine
slows down, and it cannot again attain full
speed until the same conditions recur.</p>

<p>The rate of speed which may be worked up
to as a maximum is determined by the position
of the paddle-wheel, which is adjustable and
floats upon the liquid although controlled in
its circular motion by the shaft which passes
through a square aperture in it and also a
sleeve extending upward from it. The duty
of the latter is to economise steam by cutting
off the jet as soon as, by its rapidity of motion,
the paddle-wheel has thrown the mercury to
the sides to such an extent as to sink to a
certain level in the centre.</p>

<p>Cheap motors coupled with cheap dynamos
will, in the twentieth century, go far towards
lightening the labours of millions whose toil is
at present far too much of a mere mechanical
nature. The dynamo itself, however, requires
to be greatly reduced in first cost. Particularly
it is necessary that the expense involved in
drawing the wire, insulating it, and winding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
machines with it, should be diminished. This
will no doubt be partly accomplished by the
electrolytic producers of copper when once
they get properly started on methods of depositing
thin strips or wires of tough copper on
to sheets of insulating material for wrapping
round the magnets and other effective parts
intended for dynamos. There is no fundamental
reason which forbids that when electro
deposition is resorted to for the recovery of
a metal from its ore it should be straightway
converted to the shape and to the purpose for
which it is ultimately intended. This consideration
has presented itself to the minds of
some of the manufacturers of aluminium, who
make many articles intended for household
use electrolytically; and it must affect many
other trades which are concerned in the output
and in the working-up of metals readily
susceptible of deposition&mdash;more particularly
such as copper.</p>

<p>The familiar aneroid barometer furnishes a
hint for another convenient form of small
steam-engine. In seeking to cheapen machinery
of this class it is of the utmost importance
that the necessity for boring out cylinders
and for planing and other expensive work
should be avoided. In the aneroid barometer
a shallow circular box is fitted with a cover,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
which is corrugated in concentric circles, and
the pressure of the superincumbent air is
caused to depress the centre of this cover
through the device of partially exhausting the
box of air and thus diminishing the internal
resistance. To the slightly moving middle
part of the cover is affixed a lever which
actuates, after some intermediate action, the
hand which moves on the dial to indicate, by
its record of variations in the weight of the
atmosphere, what the prospect of the weather
may be.</p>

<p>In the aneroid form of the steam-engine the cylinder is immensely
widened and flattened, and the broad circular lid, with its spiral
corrugations, takes the place of the piston. The rod, which acts
virtually as a piston-rod, is hollow, and it works into a bearing
which permits the steam to escape when the extreme point of the stroke
has been reached into a separate condensing chamber kept cool with
water. The boiler itself, with corrugated top, may take the place of
the cylinder.</p>

<p>In some respects this little machine represents
a retrograde movement, even from Watt's
original engine with its separate condenser;
but its extreme economy of first cost recommends
it to poor producers. In the near
future no country homestead will be without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
its power installation of one kind or another,
and there is room for many types of cheap
motors.</p>

<p>A motor like the steam-turbine is evidently
the forerunner of other engines designed to
utilise the force of an emission jet of vapour
or gas. There are very many processes in
which gases generated by chemical combinations
are permitted to escape without performing
any services, not even that of giving up
the energy which they may be made to store
up when held in compression in a closed vessel.</p>

<p>The reciprocating forms found suitable for
steam and gas engines are hardly adaptable for
experiments in the direction of economising
this source of power, one fatal objection in
the majority of cases being the corrosive
effects of the gases generated upon the insides
of cylinders and other working parts. As
soon as the force of the emission jet can be
applied as a factor in giving motive power,
the fact that no close-fitting parts are required
for the places upon which the line of force
impinges will alter the conditions of the whole
problem. In the centrifugal sand pump, as
now largely used for raising silt from rivers
and harbours, the serious corrosive action of
the jet of sand and water upon the inside of
the pump has been successfully overcome by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
facing the metal with indiarubber; but nothing
of the kind could have been done if the working
of the apparatus had depended on the motion
of close-fitting parts, as in the ordinary suction
or lift pump.</p>

<p>As an instance of the class of work for
which gaseous jets, for driving turbines or
similar forms of motor, may perform useful
services the case of farm-made superphosphate
of lime may be cited. By subjecting bones
to the action of sulphuric acid the farmer may
manufacture his own phosphatic manures for
the enrichment of his land. But the carbonic
dioxide and other gases generated as the result
of the operation are wasted. Therefore it at
present pays better to carry the bones to the
sulphuric acid than to reverse the procedure
by conveying the acid to the farm, where the
bones are a by-product.</p>

<p>So bulky are the latter, however, that
serious waste of labour is involved in transporting
them for long distances. Calculations
made out by the experts of various state agricultural
stations show that, as a general rule,
it is now cheaper for the farmer to buy his
superphosphates ready made than to make
them on his farm. The difference in some
cases, however, is not great; and only a comparative
trifle would be needed in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
turn the balance. This may probably be found
in the economic value of the service rendered
by a turbine-engine or other device for utilising
the expansive power of the gases which are
driven from the constituents of the bones by
the action of the sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>For pumping water and other ordinary farm
operations the chemical gas-engine will prove
very handy; and the great point in its favour
will be that instead of useless cinders the
refuse from it will consist of the most valuable
compost with which the farmer can dress the
soil. Enamelled iron will be employed for
the troughs in which the bones and acid will
be mixed, and a cover similar to that placed
over a "Papin's digester" will be clamped to
the rim all round, the gases being liberated
only in the form of a jet used for driving
machinery.</p>

<p>For very small motors, applicable specially
to domestic purposes such as ventilation,
there is one source of power which, in all
places within the reticulation areas of waterworks,
may be had practically for nothing.
Probably when the owners of water-supply
works realise that they have command of
something which is of commercial value,
although hitherto unnoticed, they will arrange
to sell not only the water which they supply,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
but also the power which can be generated by
its escape when utilised and by the variations
in the pressure from hour to hour and even
from minute to minute.</p>

<p>The latter, for such purposes as ventilation,
for instance, will no doubt come to the front
sooner than the intermittent power now wasted
by the outflowing of water&mdash;a power which
is comparatively too small an item in most
cases to compensate for the outlay and trouble
of arranging for the storage of energy. But
in the case of the variation in the pressure,
without any escape of water at all, no such
disability appears. Experiments conducted
in several of the larger cities of England with
various types of water meters&mdash;which are
really motors on a small scale&mdash;have proved
the practicability of obtaining a source of
constant power from what may be termed the
ebb and the flow of pressure within the pipes
of a water supply system.</p>

<p>At every hour of the day there is a marked
variation in the quantity of water that is being
drawn away by consumers, and consequently
a rise and fall in the degree of pressure recorded
by the meter. In an apparatus for
converting the power derivable from this
source to useful purposes something on a very
small scale analogous to that which has already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
been described in connection with utilising the
rise and fall of a wave will be found serviceable.
A small spur-wheel is gripped on two
sides by two metal laths, with edges serrated
like those of saws, and held against the wheel
by gentle pressure. Every movement of the
two saws&mdash;whether backwards or forwards&mdash;is
then responded to by a continuous circular
motion of the wheel, with the sole exception
of those movements which may be too small in
extent to include even as much as a single
tooth of the wheel. On this account it is important
that the teeth should be made as
numerous as possible consistently with the
amount of pressure which they may have to
bear.</p>

<p>Resort may be had to the principle of the
aneroid barometer in order to secure from
the water within the pipe-system the energy
by which these saw-like bands are driven up
and down with reciprocal motion. A very
shallow circular tank in the shape of a watch
is in communication with the water in the
pipes, and its top or covering is composed of
a concentrically-corrugated sheet of finely
tempered steel. At the centre of this is fixed
the guide which pushes and pulls the saw-like
laths. Every rise and fall in the pressure of
the water now effects a movement of the spur-wheel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and the latter may conveniently be connected
with the strong spring of a clockwork
attachment, so that the water pressure is
really used for winding up a clockwork ventilating-fan.</p>

<p>In the making of cheap steam and gas
engines, as well as in machine work generally,
rapid progress will be made when the possibilities
of producing hard and smooth wearing
surfaces without the need for cutting and
filing rough-cast metal have been fully investigated.
Many parts of machinery will be
electro-deposited&mdash;like the small articles
already mentioned&mdash;in aluminium or hard
copper at the metallurgical works where ore
is being treated for the recovery of metal, or
even at the mines themselves.</p>

<p>Side by side with this movement there will
be one for developing the system of stamping
mild steel and then tempering it. At the
same time also the behaviour of various metals
and alloys, not only in the cold state but also
at the critical point between melting and
solidification, will be much more carefully
studied so as to take advantage of every means
whereby accurately shaped articles may be
made and finished in the casting. It has been
found, for example, that certain kinds of type
metal, if placed under very heavy pressure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
at the moment when passing from the liquid
to the solid condition, not only take the exact
form of the mould in which they are placed,
but become extremely hard by comparison
with the same alloy if permitted to solidify
without pressure.</p>

<p>The example of the cheap watch industry
may be cited to convey an idea of the immensely
important revolution which will take
place in the production of both small and
large prime-motors when all the possibilities
of electrotyping, casting, and stamping the
various wearing parts true to shape and size
have been fully exploited. An accurate timekeeper
is now practically within the reach of
all; and in the twentieth century no one who
requires a small prime motor to do the rough
work about home or farm will be compelled
to do without it by reason of poverty&mdash;unless,
perhaps, he is absolutely destitute and a fit
subject for public charity.</p>

<p>Many domestic industries which were
crushed out of existence during the early
part of the nineteenth century will therefore
be resuscitated. The dear steam-engine
created the factory system and brought the
operatives to live close together in long rows
of unsightly dwellings, but the cheap engine,
in conjunction with the motor driven by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
transmitted electricity, will give to the
working people comparative freedom again
to live where they please, and to enjoy the
legitimate pleasures both of town and of
country.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>ROAD AND RAIL.</h3>


<p>The existing keen motor-car rivalry presents
one of the most interesting and instructive
mechanical problems which are left still unsolved
by the close of the nineteenth century.
The question to be determined is not so much
whether road locomotion by means of mechanical
power is practicable and useful, for, of
course, that point has been settled long ago;
indeed it would have been recognised as settled
years before had it not been for the crass
legislation of a quarter of a century since which
deliberately drove the first steam-motors off
the road in order to ensure the undisturbed
supremacy of horse traffic. The real point at
issue is whether a motor can be made which
shall furnish power for purposes of road locomotion
as cheaply and conveniently as is already
done for stationary purposes.</p>

<p>Horse traction, although extremely dear,
possesses one qualification which until the
present day has enabled it to outdistance its
mechanical competitors upon ordinary roads.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
This is its power of adapting itself, by special
effort, to the exigencies caused by the varying
nature of the road. Watch a team of horses
pulling a waggon along an undulating highway,
with level stretches of easy going and here
and there a decline or a steep hill. There is
a continual adjustment of the strain which
each animal puts upon itself according to the
character of the difficulties which must be
surmounted, the effort varying from nothing
at all&mdash;when going down a gentle decline&mdash;up
to the almost desperate jerk with which the
vehicle is taken over some stony part right on
the brow of an eminence. The whip cracks and
by threats and encouragements the driver induces
each horse to put forth, for one brief
moment, an effort which could not be sustained
for many minutes save at the peril of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>When the unit of nominal horse-power was
fixed at 33,000 foot-pounds per minute the
work contemplated in the arbitrary standard
was supposed to be such as a horse could go
on performing for several hours. It was, of
course, well recognised that any good, upstanding
horse, if urged to a special effort, could
perform several times the indicated amount of
work in a minute.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the habit of reckoning steam-power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in terms of a unit drawn from the analogy of the horse undoubtedly
tended for many years to obscure the essential difference between the
natures of the two sources of power. Railroads were built with the
object of rendering as uniform as possible the amount of power
required to transport a given weight of goods or passengers over a
specified distance; and consequently the application of the
steam-engine to traffic conducted on the railway line was a success.
Many inventors at once jumped to the conclusion that, by making some
fixed allowance for the greater roughness of an ordinary road, they
would be able to construct a steam-traction engine that would suit
exactly for road traffic. In a rough and rudimentary way an attempt to
provide for the special effort required at steep or stony places was
made by the introduction of a kind of fly-wheel of extraordinary
weight proportionate to the size of the engine; and the same object
was aimed at by increasing the power of the engine to somewhere near
the limit of the possible special requirements. The consequence was the
evolution of an immensely ponderous and wasteful machine, which for some
years only held its ground within the domain of the heavy work of roadmaking.
As a means of road traction the steam-engine was for half a century almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
entirely discomfited and routed by horse-power, partly owing to this
mechanical defect and partly, as we have seen, through legislative
partisanship.</p>

<p>The explosive type of engine was next called
into requisition to do battle against the living
competitor of the engineer's handiwork. Petroleum
and alcohol, when volatilised and mixed
with air in due proportion, form explosive
mixtures which are much more nearly instantaneous
in their action than an elastic vapour
like steam held under pressure in a boiler, and
liberated to perform its work by comparatively
slow expansion. The petroleum engine, as
applied to the automobile, does its work in a
series of jerks which provide for the unequal
degrees of power required to cope with the
unevenness of a road.</p>

<p>As against this, however, there are certain
grave defects, due mainly to the use of highly
inflammable oils vapourised at high temperatures;
and these have impressed a large
proportion of engineers with a belief that, in
the long run, either electricity or steam will
win the day. Storage batteries are well adapted
for meeting the exigencies of the road, just as
they are for those of tramway traffic, because,
as soon as an extra strain is to be met, there
is always the resource of coupling up fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
batteries held in reserve&mdash;a process which
amounts to the same as yoking new horses
to the vehicle in order to take it up a hill. In
practice, however, it is found that the jerky
vibratory motion of the gasoline automobile
provides for this in a way almost as convenient,
although not so pleasant.</p>

<p>The chance of the steam-engine being largely
adopted for automobile work and for road
traffic generally depends principally on the
prospects of inventing a form of cylinder&mdash;or
its equivalent&mdash;which will enable the driver to
couple up fresh effective working parts of his
machinery at will, just as may be done with
storage batteries. A new form of steam
cylinder designed to provide for this need will
outwardly resemble a long pipe&mdash;one being
fixed on each lower side of the vehicle&mdash;but
inwardly it will be divided into compartments
each of which will have its own separate
piston. Practically there will thus be a series
of cylinders having one piston-rod running
through them all, but each having its own
piston.</p>

<p>Normally, this machine will run with an
admission of steam to only one or two of the
cylinders; but when extra work has to be
done the other cylinders will be called into
requisition by the opening of the steam valves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
leading to them. Provision can be made for
the automatic working of this adjustment by
the introduction of a spring upon the piston-rod,
so arranged that, as soon as the resistance
reaches a certain point, a lever is actuated
which opens the valves to admit steam to the
reserve cylinders of the engine. On such
occasions, of course, the consumption of steam
must necessarily be greatly increased; but on
the other hand the automatic system of the
admission to each cylinder also results in a
shutting off of the steam when little or no
work is required. In fact, with a fully automatic
action, regulating the consumption of
steam exactly according to the amount of
force necessary to drive the automobile, it
would be possible to work even a single
cylinder to much greater advantage than is
done by the machines generally in use.</p>

<p>So heavy are the storage batteries needed
for electric traction of the road motor-car that
practically it is not found convenient to carry
enough of cells to last for more than a twenty-mile
run. The batteries must then either be
replaced, or a delay of some three hours must
occur while they are being recharged. The
idea of establishing charging stations at almost
every conceivable terminus of a run is quite
chimerical; and, even if hundreds of such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
stations were provided for the convenience of
the users of electric traction, the limitation
imposed by being forced to follow the established
routes would always give to the non-electric
motor an advantage over its competitor.</p>

<p>The best hope for the storage battery on
the automobile rests upon its convenience as a
repository of reserve power in conjunction
with such a prime motor as the steam-engine.
A turbine worked by a jet of steam, as already
described, and moving in a magnetic field to
generate electricity for storage in a few cells,
is a convenient form in which steam and
electricity can be yoked together in order to
secure a power of just the type suitable for
driving an automobile. In the machine indicated
the supply of the motive power is direct
from the storage batteries, which can be
coupled up in any required number according
to the exigencies of the road. Automatic gear
may be introduced by an adaptation of the
principle already referred to.</p>

<p>In a light road-motor for carrying one or
two persons on holiday trips or business
rounds, the quality of adaptability of the
source of power to the sudden demands due
to differences of level in the road is not so
absolutely essential as it is in traction engines
designed for the transport of goods over ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
roads. In the former class of work the
waste of power involved in employing a motor
of strength sufficient to climb hills&mdash;although
the bulk of the distance to be travelled is
along level roads&mdash;may not be at all so serious
as to overbalance the many and manifest
advantages of the automobile principle. At
the same time, as has already been indicated,
there is no doubt whatever that when proper
automatic shut-off contrivances have been
applied for economising mechanical energy
in the passenger road-motor, an immense impetus
will be given to its advancement.</p>

<p>In the road traction-engine the need for
what may be termed <i>effort</i> on the part of the
mechanism is much greater, more especially
as the competition against horse-traction is
conducted on terms so much more nearly level.
A team of strong draught-horses driven by
one man on a well-loaded waggon is a far
more economical installation of power than a
two-horse buggy carrying one or two passengers.</p>

<p>The asphalt and macadamised tracks which
are now being laid down along the sides of
roads for the convenience of cyclists, are the
significant forerunners of an improvement destined
to produce a revolution in road traffic
during the twentieth century. When automobiles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
have become very much more numerous,
and local authorities find that the settlement of
wealthy or comparatively well-to-do families in
their neighbourhoods may depend very largely
upon the question whether light road-motor
traffic may be conveniently conducted to and
from the nearest city, an immense impetus will
be administered to the reasonable efforts made
for catering for the demand for tracks for the
accommodation of automobiles, both private
and public.</p>

<p>The tyranny of the railway station will then
be to a large extent mitigated, and suburban
or country residents will no longer be practically
compelled to crowd up close to each
station on their lines of railroad. Under
existing conditions many of those who travel
fifteen or twenty miles to business every day
live just as close to one another, and with
nearly as marked a lack of space for lawn and
garden, as if they lived within the city. The
bunchy nature of settlement promoted by railways
must have excited the notice of any
intelligent observer during the past twenty or
thirty years&mdash;that is to say since the suburban
railroad began to take its place as an important
factor in determining the locating of population.</p>

<p>To a very large extent the automobile will
be rather a feeder to the railway than a rival
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to it; and all sorts of by-roads and country
lanes will be improved and adapted so as to
admit of residents running into their stations
by their own motor-cars and then completing
their journeys by rail. But when this point
has been reached, and when fairly smooth
tracks adapted for automobile and cycling
traffic have been laid down all over the country,
a very interesting question will crop up having
reference to the practicability of converting
these tracks into highways combining the capabilities
both of roads and of railways.</p>

<p>In an ordinary railroad the functions of the
iron or steel rails are twofold, first to carry
the weight of the load, and second to guide
the engine, carriage or truck in the right direction.
Now the latter purpose&mdash;in the case
of a rail-track never used for high speeds,
especially in going round curves&mdash;might be
served by the adoption of a very much lighter
weight of rail, if only the carrying of the load
could be otherwise provided for. In fact, if
pneumatic-tyre wheels, running on a fairly
smooth asphalt track, were employed to bear
the weight of a vehicle, there would then be no
need for more than one guide-rail, which might
readily be fixed in the middle of the track; but
this should preferably be made to resemble the
rail of a tram rather than that of a railroad.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
"Every man his own engine-driver" will be
a rule which will undoubtedly require some
little social and mechanical adjustment to carry
out within the limits of the public safety.
But the automobile, even in its existing form,
makes the task of completing this adjustment
practically a certainty of the near future; and
as soon as it is seen that motor tracks with
guide lines render traffic safer than it is on
ordinary roads, the main objections to the
innovation will be rapidly overcome. The
rule of the road for such guide-line tracks will
probably be based very closely on that which
at present exists for ordinary thoroughfares.
On those roads where two tracks have been
laid down each motor will be required to keep
to the left, and when a traveller coming up
behind is impatient at the slow rate of speed
adopted by his precursor he will be compelled
to make the necessary d&eacute;tour himself, passing
into the middle of the thoroughfare and there
outstripping the party in front, without the
assistance of the guide-rail, and rejoining the
track.</p>

<p>To execute this movement, of course, the
motor wheels for the guide-tracks must be
mounted on entirely different principles from
those adapted for railroad traffic. The broad
and soft tyred wheels which bear upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
asphalt track will be entrusted with the duty
of carrying the machine without extraneous
aid; but there will be two extra wheels, one
in front and one at the rear, capable of being
lifted at any time by means of a lever controlled
by the driver. These guiding wheels will fit
into the groove of the tram line in the centre,
being made of a shape suitable for enabling
the driver to pick up the groove quickly whenever
he pleases. The carrying wheels of the
vehicle in this system are enabled to pass over
the guide-rail readily, because the latter does
not stand up from the track like the line in a
railroad.</p>

<p>A simpler plan, particularly adapted for
roads which are to have only a single guide-rail,
is to place the rail at the off-side of the
track, and to raise it a few inches from the
ground. The wheels for the rail are attached
to arms which can be raised and lifted off the
rail by the driver operating a lever. Guiding
irons, forming an inverted Y, are placed below
the bearings of the wheels to facilitate the
picking up of the rail, their effect being that,
if the driver places his vehicle in approximately
the position for engaging the side wheels with
the rail and then goes slowly ahead, he will
very quickly be drawn into the correct alignment.
Of course the rails for this kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
track can be very light and inexpensive in
comparison with those required for railroads
on which the whole weight of each vehicle, as
well as the lateral strain caused by its guidance,
must fall upon the rail itself.</p>

<p>The asphalt track and its equivalent will be
the means of bringing much nearer to fulfilment
the dream of having "a railway to every
man's door". Many such tracks will be equipped
with electric cables as well as guiding-rails, so
that cars with electric motors will be available
for running on them, and the power will be
supplied from a publicly-maintained station.
Some difficulty may at first be experienced in
adjusting the rates and modes of payment for
the facilities thus offered; but a convenient
precedent is present to hand in the class of
enactment under which tramway companies
are at present protected from having their permanent
ways used by vehicles owned by other
persons. Practically the possession of a vehicle
having a flanged wheel and a gauge exactly
the same as that of the tram lines in the
vicinity may be taken to indicate an intention
to use the lines. Similarly a certain relation
between the positions of guiding wheels and
those of the connections with cables may be
held to furnish evidence of liability to contribute
towards the maintenance of motor-tracks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Roads and railways will be much more
closely inter-related in the future than they
have been in the past. The competition of the
automobile would in itself be practically sufficient
to force the owners of railways into a
more adaptive mood in regard to the true relations
between the world's great highways.
The way in which the course of evolution will
work the problem out may be indicated thus:&mdash;First,
the owners of automobiles will find it
convenient in many instances to run by road
to the nearest railway station which suits their
purposes, leaving their machines in charge
of the stationmaster and going on by train.
In course of time the owners of "omnibus
automobiles" will desire to secure the same
advantage for their customers, and on this
account the road cars will await the arrival
and departure of every train just as horse
vehicles do at present. The next step will be
taken by the railway companies, or by the
local authorities, when it becomes obvious that
there is much more profit in motor traffic than
there ever was in catering for the public by
means of vehicles drawn by horses. Each
important railway station will have its diverging
lines of motor-traffic for the convenience of
passengers, some of them owned and managed
by the same authority as the railway line itself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Rivalry will shortly enforce an improvement
upon this system, because in the keen competition
between railway lines those stations
will attract the best parts of the trade at
which the passengers are put to the smallest
amount of inconvenience. The necessity for
changing trains, with its attendant bustle of
looking after luggage, perhaps during very inclement
weather, always acts as a hindrance
to the popularity of a line. When "motor-omnibuses"
are running by road all the way
into the city, setting people down almost at
their doors and making wide circuits by road,
the proprietors of these vehicles will make the
most of their advantages in offering to travellers
a cosy and comfortable retreat during the
whole of their journey.</p>

<p>Road-motors, comfortably furnished, will
therefore be mounted upon low railway trucks
of special construction, designed to permit of
their being run on and off the trucks from the
level of the ground. The plan of mounting a
road vehicle upon a truck suited to receive it
has already been adopted for some purposes,
notably for the removal of furniture and similar
goods; and it is capable of immense extension.
An express train will run through on the
leading routes from which roads branch out
in all directions, and as it approaches each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
station it will uncouple the truck and "motor-omnibus"
intended for that destination. The
latter will be shunted on to a loopline. The
road-motor will be set free from its truck and
will then proceed on its journey by road.</p>

<p>When a similar system has been fully adapted
for the conveyance of goods by rail and road
experiments will then be commenced, on a
systematic basis, with the object of rendering
possible the picking up of packages, and even
of vehicles, without stopping the train. The
most pressing problem which now awaits
solution in the railway world is how to serve
roadside stations by express trains. "Through"
passengers demand a rapid service; while the
roadside traffic goes largely to the line that
offers the most frequent trains. In the violent
strain and effort to combine these two desiderata
the most successful means yet adopted
have been those which rely upon the destruction
of enormous quantities of costly engine-power
by means of quick-acting brakes. The
amount of power daily converted into the
mischievous heat of friction by the brakes on
some lines of railway would suffice to work
the whole of the traffic several times over;
but the sacrifice has been enforced by the
public demand for a train that shall run fast
and shall yet stop as frequently as possible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Progress in this direction has reached its
limit. A brake that shall conserve, instead of
destroying, the power of the train's inertia on
pulling up at a station is urgently required;
but the efforts towards supplying the want
have not, so far, proved very successful. Each
carriage or truck must be fitted with an air-pump
so arranged that, on the application of
the brake by the engine-driver, it shall drive
back a corresponding amount of air to that
which has been liberated from the reservoir,
and the energy thus stored must be rendered
available for re-starting the train. Trials
in this direction have been made through
the application of strong springs which are
caused to engage upon the wheels when the
brake is applied, and thus are wound up, but
which may then be reversed in position, so
that for the starting of the vehicle the rebound
of the spring offers material assistance. It is
obvious, however, that the use of compressed
air harmonises better with the railway system
than any plan depending upon springs. The
potential elasticity in an air-reservoir of portable
dimensions is enormously greater than
that of any metallic spring which could conveniently
be carried.</p>

<p>In picking up and setting down mail-bags a
system has been for some years in operation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
on certain railway lines indicating in a small
way the possibilities of the future in the direction
of obviating the need for stopping trains
at stations. The bag is hung on a sliding rod
outside of the platform, and on a corresponding
part of the van is affixed a strong net, which
comes in contact with the bag and catches it
while the train goes past at full speed. Dropping
a bag is, of course, a simpler matter.</p>

<p>The occasionally urgent demand for the sending
of parcels in a similar manner has set many
inventive brains to work on the problem of
extending the possibilities of this system, and
there seems no reason to doubt that before
long it will be practicable to load some classes
of small, and not readily broken, articles into
trucks or vans while trains are in motion.</p>

<p>The root idea from which such an invention
will spring may be borrowed from the sliding
rail and tobogganing devices already introduced
in pleasure grounds for the amusement of those
who enjoy trying every novel excitement. A
light and very small truck may be caused to
run down an incline and to throw itself into
one of the trucks comprising a goods train.
The method of timing the descent, of course,
will only be definitely ascertained after careful
calculation and experiments designed to determine
what length of time must elapse between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the liberation of the small descending truck
and the passing of the vehicle into which its
contents are to be projected.</p>

<p>Foot-bridges over railway lines at wayside
stations will afford the first conveniences to
serve as tentative appliances for the purpose
indicated. From the overway of the bridge
are built out two light frameworks carrying
small tram-lines which are set at sharp declivities
in the directions of the up and the down
trains respectively, and which terminate at a
point just high enough to clear the smoke-stack
of the engine.</p>

<p>The small truck, into which the goods to be
loaded are stowed with suitable packings to
prevent undue concussion, is held at the top
of its course by a catch, readily released by
pressure on a lever from below. The guard's
van is provided at its front end with a steel,
upright rod carrying a cross-piece, which is
easily elevated by the guard or his assistant
in anticipation of passing any station where
parcels are to be received by projection. At
the rear of the van is an open receptacle communicating
by a door or window with the van
itself. At the instant when the steel cross-piece
comes in contact with the lever of the
catch, which holds the little truck in position
on the elevated footbridge, the descent begins,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and by the time that the receptacle behind
the van has come directly under the end of
the sloping track the truck has reached the
latter point and is brought to a sudden standstill
by buffers at the termination of the miniature
"toboggan". The ends of the little truck
being left open, its contents are discharged into
the receptacle behind the van, from which the
guard or assistant in charge removes them into
the vehicle itself. For catching the parcels
thrown out from the van a much simpler set
of apparatus is sufficient.</p>

<p>On a larger scale, no doubt in course of time,
a somewhat similar plan will be brought into
operation for causing loaded trucks to run from
elevated sidings and to join themselves on to
trains in motion. One essential condition for
the attainment of this object is that the rails
of the siding should be set at such a steep
declivity that, when the last van of the passing
train has cleared the points and set the waiting
truck in motion by liberating its catch, the
rate of speed attained by the pursuing vehicle
should be sufficiently high to enable it to catch
the train by its own impetus.</p>

<p>It may be found more convenient on some
lines to provide nearly level sidings and to
impart the necessary momentum to the waiting
truck, partly through the propelling agency
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of compressed air. Any project for what will
be described as "shooting a truck loaded with
valuable goods after the retreating end of a
train," in order to cause it to catch up with
the moving vehicles, will no doubt give rise to
alarm; and this feeling will be intensified when
further proposals for projecting carriages full
of passengers in a similar method come up for
discussion. But these apprehensions will be
met and answered in the light of the fact that
in the earlier part of the nineteenth century
critics of what was called "Stephenson's mad
scheme" of making trains run twenty or even
thirty miles an hour were gradually induced
to calm their nerves sufficiently to try the new
experience of a train journey!</p>

<p>The wire-rope tramway has hitherto been
used principally in connection with mines
situated in very hilly localities. Trestles are
erected at intervals upon which a strong steel
rope is stretched and this carries the buckets
or trucks slung on pulley-blocks, contrived so
as to pass the supports without interference.
A system of this kind can be worked electrically,
the wire-rope being employed also for the
conveyance of the current. But an inherent
defect in the principle lies in the fact that the
wire-rope dips deeply when the weight passes
over it, and thus the progress from one support
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
to another resolves itself into a series
of sharp descents, followed by equally sharp
ascents up a corresponding incline. The
usual way of working the traffic is to haul the
freight by means of a rope wound round a
windlass driven by a stationary engine at the
end. The constantly varying strain on the
cable proves how large is the amount of
power that must be wasted in jerking the
buckets up one incline to let them jolt down
another when the point of support has been
passed.</p>

<p>Hitherto the wire-rope tramway has been
usually adopted merely as presenting the lesser
of two evils. If the nature of the hills to be
traversed be so precipitous that ruinous cuttings
and bridges would be needed for the
construction of an ordinary railway or tramway
line, the idea of conveyance by wire
suggests itself as being, at least, a temporary
mode of getting over the difficulty. But a
great extension of the principle of overhead
haulage may be expected as soon as the dipping
of the load has been obviated, and the
portion of the moving line upon which it is
situated has been made rigid. A strong but
light steel framework, placed in the line of
the drawing-cable, and of sufficient length to
reach across two of the intervals between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
supports, may be drawn over enlarged pulleys
and remain quite rigid all the time.</p>

<p>The weight-carrying wire-rope is thus dispensed
with, and the installation acquires a
new character, becoming, in point of fact, a
moving bridge which is drawn across its
supports and fits into the grooves in the wheels
surmounting the latter. The carriage or truck
may be constructed on the plan adopted for
the building of the longest type of modern
bogie carriages for ordinary railways, the
tensile strength of steel rods being largely
utilised for imparting rigidity. We now find
that instead of a railway we have the idea of
what may be more appropriately called a
"wheelway". The primitive application of
the same principle is to be seen in the devices
used in dockyards and workshops for moving
heavy weights along the ground by skidding
them on rollers. Practically the main precaution
observed in carrying out this operation
is the taking care that no two rollers are put
so far apart that the centre of gravity of the
object to be conveyed shall have passed over
one before the end has come in contact with
the next just ahead of it.</p>

<p>The "wheelway" itself will be economical
in proportion as the length of the rigid carriage
or truck which runs upon it is increased.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
The carrying of cheap freight will be the
special province of the apparatus, and it will
therefore be an object to secure the form of
truck which will give, with the least expense,
the greatest degree of rigidity over the longest
stretch of span from one support to another.
Some modification of the tubular principle will
probably supply the most promising form for
the purpose. The hope of this will be greatly
enhanced through the recent advances in the
art of tube-constructing by which wrought-iron
and tough steel tubes can be made quite
seamless and jointless, being practically forged
at one operation in the required tubular shape.</p>

<p>For mining and other similar purposes, the
long tubal "wheelway" trucks of this description
can be drawn up an incline at the loading
station so as to be partially "up-ended" in
position for receiving the charges or loads of
mineral or other freight. After this they can
be despatched along the "wheelway" on the
closing of the door at the loading end. In
regard to the mode of application of the power
in traction, the shorter-distance lines may
serve their objects well enough by adopting
the endless wire-rope system at present used
on many mining properties.</p>

<p>But it is found in practice that for heavy
freight this endless cable traction does not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
suit over distances of more than about two
miles. Mining men insist upon the caution
that where this length of distance has to be
exceeded in the haulage of ore from the mine
over wire-rope tramways, there is need for two
installations, the loaded trucks being passed
along from one to the other by means of
suitable appliances at the termini.</p>

<p>Electric traction must, in the near future,
displace such a cumbrous system, and the plan
upon which it will be applied will probably
depend upon the use of a steel cable along
which the motor-truck must haul itself in its
progress. This cable will be kept stationary,
but gripped by the wheels and other appliances
of the electric motors with which the long
trucks are provided. Besides this there must
also be the conducting cables for the conveyance
of the electric current.</p>

<p>For cheap means of transport in sparsely-developed
country, as well as in regions of
an exceptionally hilly contour, the "wheelway"
has a great future before it. Ultimately the
system can be worked out so as to present an
almost exact converse of the railway. The
rails are fixed on the lower part of the elongated
truck, one on each side; while the
wheels, placed at intervals upon suitable supports,
constitute the permanent way. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
amount of constructional work required for
each mile of track under this plan is a mere
fraction of that which is needed for the permanent
way and rolling stock of a railway, the
almost entire absence of earth-works being, of
course, a most important source of economy.</p>

<p>Probably the development of transport on
the principles indicated by the evolution of
the ropeway or wire-rope tramway will take
place primarily in connection with mining
properties, and for general transport purposes
in country of a nature which renders it unsuitable
for railway construction. This applies
not merely to hilly regions, but particularly to
those long stretches of sandy country which
impede the transport of traffic in many rich
mining regions, and in patches separating good
country from the seaboard. In the "wheelway"
for land of this character the wheels need
not be elevated more than a very few feet
above the ground, just enough to keep them
clear of the drift sand which in some places is
fatal to the carrying out of any ordinary railway
project.</p>

<p>The conception of a truck or other vehicle
that shall practically carry its own rail-road
has been an attractive one to some inventive
minds. In sandy regions, and in other places
where a railway track is difficult to maintain,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and where, at any rate, there would hardly be
sufficient traffic to encourage expenditure in
laying an iron road, a very great boon would be
a kind of motor which would lay its own rails
in front of its wheels and pick them up again
as soon as they had passed.</p>

<p>A carriage of this kind was worked for some
time on the Landes in France. The track was
virtually a kind of endless band which ran round
the four wheels, bearing a close resemblance
to the ramp upon which the horse is made to
tread in the "box" type of horse-gear. Several
somewhat similar devices have been brought
out, and a gradual approach seems to have
been made towards a serviceable vehicle.</p>

<p>A large wheel offers less resistance to the
traction of the weight upon it than a small
one. The principal reason for this is that its
outer periphery, being at any particular point
comparatively straight, does not dip down into
every hollow of the road, but strikes an average
of the depressions and prominences which it
meets. The pneumatic tyre accomplishes the
same object, although in a different way, the
weight being supported by an elastic surface
which fits into the contour of the ground beneath
it; and the downward pressure being
balanced by the sum total of all the resistant
forces offered by every part of the tyre which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
touches the ground, whether resting on hollows
or on prominences.</p>

<p>Careful tests which have been made with
pneumatic-tyred vehicles by means of various
types of dynamometer have proved that, altogether
apart from the question of comfort
arising from absence of vibration, there is a
very true and real saving of actual power in
the driving of a vehicle on wheels fitted with
inflated tubes, as compared with the quantity
that is required to propel the same vehicle
when resting on wheels having hard unyielding
rims. So far as cycles and motor-cars are
concerned, this is the best solution of the problem
of averaging the inequalities of a road that
has yet been presented; but when we come to
consider the making of provision for goods
traffic carried by traction engines along ordinary
roadways, the difficulties which present
themselves militating against the adoption of
the pneumatic principle&mdash;at any rate so long
as a cheap substitute for india-rubber is undiscovered&mdash;are
practically insurmountable.</p>

<p>Large cart wheels of the ordinary type are
much more difficult to construct than small
ones, besides being more liable to get out of
order. The advantages of a large over a small
wheel in reducing the amount of resistance
offered by rough roads have long been recognised,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and the limit of height was soon attained.
In looking for improvement in this direction,
therefore, we must inquire what new types of
wheel may be suggested, and whether an intermediate
plan between the endless band, as
already referred to, and the old-fashioned large
wheel may not find a useful place.</p>

<p>Let the wheel consist of a very small truck-wheel
running on the inside of a large, rigid
steel hoop. The latter must be supported, to
keep it from falling to either side, by means of
a steel semi-circular framework rising from
the sides of the vehicle and carrying small
wheels to prevent friction. We now have a
kind of rail which conforms to the condition
already mentioned, namely, that of being
capable of being laid down in front of the
wheel of the truck or vehicle, and of being
picked up again when the weight has passed
over any particular part. The hoop, in fact,
constitutes a rolling railway, and the larger it
can with convenience be made, the nearer is
the approach which it presents to a straight
railway track as regards the absence of resistance
to the passing of a loaded truck-wheel
over it.</p>

<p>The method of applying the rolling hoop, more particularly as regards
the question whether two or four shall be used for a vehicle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
will depend upon the special work to be performed. Some vehicles, however,
will have only two hoops, one on each side, but several small
truck-wheels running on the inside of each. A vehicle of this pattern
is not to be classed with a two-wheeled buggy, because it will
maintain its equilibrium without being held in position by shafts or
other similar means. So far as contact with the road is concerned it
is two-wheeled; and yet, in its relation to the force of gravitation
upon which its statical stability depends, it is a four or six-wheeler
according to the number of the small truck-wheels with which it is
fitted.</p>

<p>Traction engines carrying hoops twenty feet
in height, or at any rate as high as may be
found compatible with stability when referred
to the available width on the road, will be
capable of transporting goods at a cost much
below that of horse traction. The limit of
available height may be increased by the
bringing of the two hoops closer to each other
at the top than they are at the roadway, because
the application of the principle does not demand
that the hoops should stand absolutely erect.</p>

<p>Similar means will, no doubt, be tried for
the achievement of a modified form of what
has been dreamt of by cyclists under the name
of a unicycle. This machine will resemble a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
bicycle running on the inner rim of a hoop,
and will probably attain to a higher speed for
show purposes than the safety high-geared
bicycle of the usual pattern. But it is in the
development of goods traffic along ordinary
roads that the hoop-rail principle will make
its most noticeable progress. By its agency
not only will the transport of goods along
well-made roads become less costly and more
expeditious, but localities in sparsely settled
countries&mdash;such as those beyond the Missouri
in America and the interior regions of South
Africa, Australia and China&mdash;will become
much more readily accessible.</p>

<p>A traction-engine and automobile which
can run across broad, almost trackless plains
at the rate of fifteen miles an hour will bring
within quick reach of civilisation many localities
in which at present, for lack of such
communication, rough men are apt to grow
into semi-savages, while those who retain the
instincts of civilisation look upon their exile
as a living death. It will do more to enlighten
the dark places of the earth than any other
mechanical agency of the twentieth century.</p>

<h3>SHIPS.</h3>


<p>The "cargo slave" and the "ocean greyhound"
are already differentiated by marked characteristics,
and in the twentieth century the
divergence between the two types of vessels
will become much accentuated. The object
aimed at by the owners of cargo boats will be
to secure the greatest possible economy of
working, combined with a moderately good
rate of speed, such as may ensure shippers
against having to stand out of their capital
locked up in the cargo for too long a period.
Hence cheap power will become increasingly
a desideratum, and the possible applications of
natural sources of energy will be keenly scrutinised
with a view to turning any feasible
plan to advantage. The sailing ship, and the
economic and constructive lines upon which it
is built and worked, will be carefully overhauled
with a view to finding how its deficiencies may
be supplemented and its good points turned
to account. One result of this renewed attention
will be to confirm, for some little time,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the movement which showed itself during the
past decade of the nineteenth century for an
increase of sailing tonnage. Sooner or later,
however, it will be recognised that sail power
must be largely supplemented, even on the
"sailer," if it is to hold its own against steam.</p>

<p>For mails and passengers, on the other hand,
steam must more and more decidedly assert
its supremacy. Yet the mail-packet of the
twentieth century will be very different from
packets which have "made the running" towards
the close of the nineteenth. She will carry
little or no cargo excepting specie, and goods
of exceptionally high value in proportion to
their weight and bulk. Nearly all her below-deck
capacity, indeed, will be filled with
machinery and fuel. She will be in other
respects more like a floating hotel than the
old ideal of a ship, her cellars, so to speak,
being crammed with coal and her upper stories
fitted luxuriously for sitting and bed rooms and
brilliant with the electric light. But in size
she will not necessarily be any larger than the
nineteenth century type of mail steamer. Indeed
the probability is that, on the average,
the twentieth century mail-packets will be
smaller, being built for speed rather than for
magnificence or carrying capacity.</p>

<p>The turbine-engine will be the main factor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in working the approaching revolution in mail
steamer construction. The special reason for
this will consist in the fact that only by its
adoption can the conditions mentioned above
be fulfilled. With the ordinary reciprocating
type of marine steam machinery it would be
impossible to place, in a steamer of moderate
tonnage, engines of a size suitable to enable it
to attain a very high rate of speed, because the
strain and vibration of the gigantic steel arms,
pulling and pushing the huge cranks to turn
the shafting, would knock the hull to pieces in
a very short time. For this very reason, in
fact, the marine architect and engineer have
hitherto urged, with considerable force of argument,
that high speed and large tonnage
must go concomitantly. Practically, only a
big steamer, with the old type of marine-engine,
could be a very fast one, and, for ocean traffic
at any rate, a smaller vessel must be regarded
as out of the running. Very large tonnage
being thus made a prime necessity, it followed
that the space provided must be utilised, and
this need has tended to perpetuate the combination
of mail and passenger traffic with
cargo carrying.</p>

<p>The first step towards the revolution was
taken many years ago when the screw propeller
was substituted for the paddle-wheel. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
latter means of propulsion caused shock and
vibration not only owing to the thrusts of the
piston-rod from the steam-engine itself, but
also from the impact of the paddles upon the
water one after the other. A great increase
in the smoothness of running was attained
when the screw was invented&mdash;a propeller
which was entirely sunk in the water and
therefore exercised its force, not in shocks,
but in gentle constant pressure upon the fluid
around it. Such as the windmill is for wind
and the turbine water-wheel for water was the
screw propeller, although adapted, not as a
generator, but as an application of power.
Having made the work and stress continuous,
the next thing to be accomplished was to
effect a similar reform in the engines supplying
the power. This is accomplished in the
turbine steam-engine by causing the steam to
play in strong jets continuously and steadily
upon vanes which form virtually a number
of small windmills. Thus, while the screw
outside of the hull is applying the force continuously,
the steam in the inside is driving
the shafting with equal evenness and regularity.</p>

<p>The steam turbine does not appear to have
by any means reached finality in its form, such
questions as the angle of impact which the jet
should make with the surface of the vane, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the size of the orifice through which the steam
should be ejected, being still debatable points.
But on one matter there is hardly any room for
doubt, and that is that the best way to secure
the benefit of the expansive power of steam is
to permit it to escape from a pipe having a
long series of orifices and to impinge upon
a correspondingly numerous series of vanes,
or, perhaps, upon a number of vanes arranged
so that each one is long enough to receive the
impact of many jets.</p>

<p>Hitherto the steam supply-pipe emitting the
jet has been placed outside of the circle of the
wheel; but the future form seems likely to be
one in which the axis of the wheel is itself
the pipe which contains the steam, but which
permits it to escape outwards to the circumference
of the wheel. The latter is, in this
form of turbine, made in the shape of a paddle-wheel
of very small circumference but considerable
length, the paddles being set at such an
inclination as to obtain the greatest possible
rotative impulse from the outward-rushing
steam. The pipe must be turned true at
intervals to enable it to carry a number of
diminutive wheels upon which these long vanes
are mounted, and a very strong connection
must be made between these wheels and the
shaft of the screw. Inasmuch as a high speed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of rotation is to be maintained, the pitch of the
screw in the water is set so as to offer but
slight opposition to the water at each turn.
The immense speed attained is thus due, not
to the actual power with which the water is
struck by the screw at each revolution, but
to the extraordinary rapidity with which the
shaft rotates.</p>

<p>The twin screw, with which the best and
safest of modern steam-ships are all fitted, will
soon develop into what may be called "the
twin stern". Each screw requires a separate
set of engines and the main object of the
duplication is to lessen the risk of the vessel
being left helpless in case of accident to one
or other. The advisability of placing each
engine and shafting in a separate water-tight
compartment has therefore been seen. At
this point there presents itself for consideration
the advisability of separating the two
screws by as wide a distance as may be convenient
and placing the rudder between the
two. Practically, therefore, it will be found
best to build out a steel framework from each
side of the stern for holding the bearings of
each screw in connection with the twin water-tight
compartments holding the shafting; and
thus will be evolved what will practically represent
a twin, or double, stern.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
In the case of the turbine steamer several
of the forms of screw which were first proposed
when that type of propeller was invented will
again come up for examination, notably the
Archimedean screw, wound round a fairly long
piece of shafting. The larger the circular area
of this screw is the less will be the risk of
"smashing" the water, or of losing hold of it
entirely in rough weather. With twin screws
of the large Archimedean type the propelling
apparatus of a turbine steamer will&mdash;if the
screws are left open&mdash;be objected to on the
ground of liability to foul or to get broken in
crowded fairways. Hence will arise a demand
for accommodation for each screw in a tube
forming part of the lower hull itself and open
at the side for the taking in of water, while
the stern part is equally free. In this way
there is evolved a kind of compromise between
the two principles of marine propulsion, by a
screw and by a jet of water thrown to sternward.
The water-jet is already very successfully employed
for the propulsion of steam lifeboats
in which, owing to the danger of fouling the
life-saving and other tackle, an open screw is
objectionable.</p>

<p>The final extermination of the sailing ship
is popularly expected as one of the first developments
of the twentieth century in maritime
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
traffic. Steam, which for oversea trade made
its entrance cautiously in the shape of a mere
auxiliary to sail power, had taken up a much
more self-assertive position long before the
close of the nineteenth century, and has driven
its former ally almost out of the field in large
departments of the shipping industry. Yet a
curious and interesting counter movement is
now taking place on the Pacific Coast of
America, as well as among the South Sea
Islands and in several other places where coal
is exceptionally dear. Trading schooners and
barques used in these localities are often fitted
with petroleum oil engines, which enable them
to continue their voyages during calm or adverse
weather. For the owners of the smaller grade
of craft it was a material point in recommendation
of this movement that, having no boiler
or other parts liable to explode and wreck
the vessel, an oil engine may be worked without
the attendance of a certificated engineer.
As soon as this legal question was settled
a considerable impetus was given to the
extension of the auxiliary principle for sailing
ships. The shorter duration of the
average voyage made by the sail-and-oil
power vessels had the effect of enabling
shippers to realise upon the goods carried
more speedily than would have been possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
under the old system of sail-power alone.</p>

<p>It is already found that in the matter of
economy of working, including interest on
cost of vessel and cargo, these oil-auxiliary
ships can well hold their own against the
ordinary steam cargo slave. Up to a certain
point, the policy of relying upon steam entirely,
unaided by any natural cheap source of power,
has been successful; but the rate of speed
which the best types of marine engines impart
to this kind of vessel is strictly limited, owing
to considerations of the enormous increase of
fuel-consumption after passing the twelve or
fourteen mile grade. For ocean greyhounds
carrying mails and passengers the prime necessity
of high speed has to a large extent
obliterated any such separating line between
waste and economy. It is, however, a mistake
to imagine that the cargo steamer of the future
will be in any sense a replica of the mail-boat
of to-day. The opposition presented by the
water to the passage of a vessel increases by
leaps and bounds as soon as the rate now
adopted by the cargo steamer is passed, and
thus presents a natural barrier beyond which
it will not be economically feasible to advance
much further.</p>

<p>If then we recognise clearly that steam cargo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
transport across the ocean can only be done
remuneratively at about one half the speed
now attained by the very fastest mail-boats, we
shall soon perceive also that the chances of the
auxiliary principle, if wisely introduced, placing
the "sailer" on a level with the cargo ship
worked by steam alone, are by no means hopeless.
A type of vessel which can be trusted
to make some ten or twelve knots regularly,
and which can also take advantage of the
power of the wind whenever it is in its favour,
must inevitably possess a material advantage
over the steam cargo slave in economy of working,
while making almost the same average
passages as its rival.</p>

<p>Then, also, the sailless cargo slave, in the
keen competition that must arise, will be fitted
with such appliances as human ingenuity can
in future devise, or has already tentatively
suggested, for invoking the aid of natural
powers in order to supplement the steam-engine
and effect a saving in fuel. One of
these will no doubt be the adoption of the
heavy pendulum with universal joint movement
in a special hold of the vessel so connected
with an air-compression plant that its
movements may continually work to fill a
reservoir of air at a high pressure. The marine
engines of the ordinary type will then be adapted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to work with compressed air, and the true steam-engine
itself will be used for operating an air
compressor on the system adopted in mines.</p>

<p>The pendulum apparatus, of course, is really
a device for enabling a vessel to derive, from
the power of the waves which raise her and
roll her, an impetus in the desired direction of
her course. Inventions of this description will
at first be only very cautiously and partially
adopted, because if there is one thing which
the master mariner fears more than another
it is any heavy moving weight in the hold, the
motions of which during a storm might possibly
become uncontrollable. When steam
was first applied to the propulsion of ships the
common argument against it was that any
machine worked by steam and having sufficient
power to propel a vessel would also develop
so much vibration as to pull her to pieces&mdash;to
say nothing of the risk of having her hull
shattered at one fell blow by the explosion
of the steam boiler. These undoubtedly are
dangers which have to be provided against,
and probably the occasional lack of care has
been the cause of many an unreported loss,
as well as of recorded mishaps from broken
tail-shafts and screws, or from explosions far
out at sea.</p>

<p>The air-compressing pendulum will no doubt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
be constructed on such a principle that, whenever
there is any danger of its weighty movements
getting beyond control or doing any
damage to the vessel, its force can be instantly
removed at will, and the apparatus can be
brought to a standstill by the application of
friction brakes and other means. The weight
may be made up of comparatively small pigs
of iron, which, through the opening of a valve
controlled from the deck by the stem of the
pendulum, can be let fall out into the hold
separately. The swinging framework would
then be steadied by the friction brake gripping
it gradually.</p>

<p>Auxiliary machinery of this class can only
be made use of, as already indicated, to a
certain strictly limited extent, owing to the
tendency of any swinging weight in a vessel
to aggravate the rolling during heavy weather.
Some tentative schemes have been put forward
for tapping a source of wave-power by providing
a vessel with flippers, resting upon the surface
of the water outside her hull, and actuating
suitable internal machinery with the object of
propulsion. A certain amount of encouragement
has been given by the performances of
small craft fitted in this way; but it is objected
by sea-faring men that the behaviour of a large
vessel, encumbered with outlying parts moving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
on the waves independently, would probably
be very erratic during a storm and would endanger
the safety of the ship itself. No kind
of floating appendage, moving independently of
the vessel, could exercise any actual force by
the uprising of a wave in lifting it without
being to some extent sunk in the water; and,
accordingly, when the waves were running
high there would be imminent risk that heavy
volumes of water would get upon the apparatus
and prevent the ship from righting itself. Many
of the schemes that have been put forward, by
patent and otherwise, for the automatic propulsion
of ships have entirely failed to commend
themselves by reason of their taking little or
no account of the behaviour of a ship, fitted
with the proposed inventions, during very rough
and trying weather.</p>

<p>The swinging pendulum, with connected
apparatus for compressing air or, perhaps, for
generating the electric current, seems to be
the most controllable and therefore the safest
of the various types of apparatus which are
applicable to the utilisation of wave-power
for propulsion. In the construction of connecting
machinery by which the movements
of a pendulum hanging up from a universal
joint may be transmitted to wheels or pistons
operating compressors or dynamos, it is necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to transform all motions passing in any
direction through the spherical or bowl-shaped
figure traced out by the end of the pendulum
in the course of its swinging. This may be
effected, for instance, in the case of a pendulum
working air-compressors, by mounting the
latter on bearings like those of the gun-carriage
in a field piece, and having two of them operating
one at right angles to the other. The
rods which carry the air-compressing pistons
are then connected to the end of the pendulum
by universal joints, and the parts which have
been likened to a gun-carriage are fixed on
pivots so as to be able to move horizontally.
Air-tight joints in the pipes which lead to the
compressed air reservoir are placed in the
bearings of this mounting. We thus have the
same kind of provision for taking advantage
of a universal movement in space as is made
in solid geometry by three co-ordinates at
right angles to one another for measuring such
movements.</p>

<p>Another plan is to have the pendulum swung
in a strong steel collar and carrying at its end
three or more air-compressing pumps set
radially, with the piston-rods thrust outwards
by a strong spring on each, but with the ends
perfectly free from any attachment, yet fitted
with a buffer or wheel. As the pendulum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
moves it throws one or more of these piston-rod
ends into contact with the inner surface
of the ring, driving it into the compressing
pump. At the top of the pendulum there is
a double or universal pipe-joint through which
the air under pressure is driven to the reservoir,
and by which the apparatus is also hung.
This is the simplest, and in some respects the
best, form.</p>

<p>A very simple type of the wave-power motor
as applied to marine propulsion is based upon
an idea taken from the mode of progression
adopted by certain crustaceans, namely the
possession of the means for drawing in and
rapidly ejecting the water. Something of the
kind will most probably be made available for
assisting in the propulsion of sailing ships
which are not furnished with machinery of
any type suitable for the driving of a screw.
A very much simplified form of the pendulous
or rocking weight is applicable in this case.
A considerable amount of cargo is stowed
away in an inner hull, taking the shape of what
is practically a gigantic cradle rocking upon
semicircular lines of railway iron laid down in
the form of ribs of the ship. To the sides of
these large rocking receptacles are connected
the rods carrying, at their other ends, the
pistons of large force-pumps which draw the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
water in at one stroke and force it out to
sternwards, below the water line, at the other.</p>

<p>In this arrangement it is obvious that only the "roll" and not the
"pitch" of the vessel can be utilised as the medium through which to
obtain propulsive force. But it is probable that fully eighty per
cent. of the movements of a vessel during a long voyage&mdash;as indicated,
say, by the direction and sweep of its mast-heads&mdash;consists of the
roll. Each ton of goods moved through a vertical distance of one foot
in relation to the hull of the vessel, has in it the potentiality of
developing, when fourteen or fifteen movements occur per minute, about
one horse-power. A cradle containing 200 tons, as may therefore be
imagined, can be made to afford very material assistance in helping
forward a sailing ship during a calm. In such tantalising weather the
"ground-swell" of the ocean usually carries past a becalmed vessel
more waste energy than is ever utilised by its sails in the briskest
and most propitious breeze.</p>

<p>For sailing ships especially, the rocking form
of wave-motor as an aid to propulsion will
be recommended on account of the fact that
when the weather is "on the beam" both of
its sources of power can be kept in full use.
The sailing vessel must tack at any rate with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the object of giving its sail power a fair chance,
and thus, when it has not a fair "wind that
follows free," it must always seek to get the
breeze on its beam, and therefore usually the
swell must be taking it sideways. It would
be only on rare occasions that a sailing vessel,
if furnished with rocking gear for using the
wave-power, would be set to go nearer to the
teeth of the wind than she would under present
conditions of using sail-power alone. The
advantage of the wave-power, however, would
be seen mainly during the calm and desultory
weather which has virtually been the means
of forcing sail-power to resign its supremacy
to steam.</p>

<p>For checking the rocker in time of heavy
weather special appliances are necessary,
which, of course, must be easily operated from
the deck. Wedge-shaped pieces with rails
attached may be driven down by screws upon
the sides of the vessel, thus having the effect
of gradually narrowing the amplitude of the
rocking motion until a condition of stability
with reference to the hull has been attained.</p>

<p>In the building of steel ships, as well as in
the construction of bridges and other erections
demanding much metal-work, great economies
will be introduced by the reduction of the
extent to which riveting will be required
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
when the full advantages of hydraulic pressure
are realised. The plates used in the building
of a ship will be "knocked-up" at one side
and split at the other, with the object of making
joints without the need for using rivets to
anything like the extent at present required.
In putting the plates thus treated together to
form the hull of a vessel the swollen side of
one plate is inserted between the split portions
of another and the latter parts are then clamped
down by heavy hydraulic pressure. This important
principle is already successfully used
in the making of rivetless pipes, and its application
to ships and bridges will be only a matter
of a comparatively short time. Through this
reform, and the further use of steel ribs for
imparting strength and thus admitting of the
employment of thinner steel plates for the
actual shell, the cost of shipbuilding will be
very greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Hoisting and unloading machines will play
a notable part in minimising the expenses of
handling goods carried by sea. The grain-elevator
system is only the beginning of a
revolution in this department which will not
end until the loading and unloading of ships
have become almost entirely the work of machinery.
The principle of the miner's tool
known as the "sand-auger" may prove itself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
very useful in this connection. From a heap
of tailings the miner can select a sample, by
boring into it with a thin tube, inside of which
revolves a shaft carrying at its end a flat steel
rotary scoop. The auger, after working its
way to the bottom of the heap, is raised, and,
of course, it contains a fair sample of the sand
at all depths from the top downwards. On a
somewhat similar principle the unloading of
ships laden with grain, ore, coal, and all other
articles which can be handled in bulk and
divided, will be carried out by machines which,
by rotary action, will work their way down to
the bottom of the hull and will then be elevated
by powerful lifting cranes. For other classes
of goods permanent packages and tramways
will be provided in each ship, and trucks will
be supplied at the wharf.</p>

<p>For coastal passages across shallow but rough
water like the English Channel, the services of
moving bridges will be called into requisition.
One of these has been at work at St. Malo on
the French coast opposite Jersey, and another
was more recently constructed on the English
coast near Brighton. For the longer and much
more important service across the Channel
submarine rails may be laid down as in the
cases mentioned, but in addition it will be
necessary to provide for static stability by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
fixing a flounder-shaped pontoon just below
the greatest depth of wave disturbance, and
just sufficient in buoyancy to take the great
bulk of the weight of the structure off the
rails. In this way passengers may be conveyed
across straits like the Channel without
the discomforts of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>The stoking difficulties on large ocean-going
steamers have become so acute that they now
suggest the conclusion that, notwithstanding
repeated failures, a really effective mechanical
stoker will be so imperatively called for as to
enforce the adoption of any reasonably good
device. The heat, grime, and general misery
of the stoke-hole have become so deterrent
that the difficulty of securing men to undertake
the work grows greater year by year, and
in recruiting the ranks of the stokers resort had
to be had more and more to those unfortunate
men whose principal motive for labour is the
insatiable desire for a drinking bout. On the
occasions of several shipwrecks in the latter
part of the nineteenth century disquieting
revelations took place showing how savagely
bitter was the feeling of the stoke-hole towards
the first saloon. As soon as the mechanical
fuel-shifter has been adopted, and the boilers
have been properly insulated in order to prevent
the overheating of the stoke-hole, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
stoker will be raised to the rank of a secondary
engineer, and his work will cease to be looked
upon as in any sense degrading.</p>

<p>On the cargo-slave steamer and sailer a similar
social revolution will be brought about by
the amelioration of the conditions under which
the men live and work. Already some owners
and masters have begun to mitigate, to a certain
extent, the embargo which the choice of a sea-faring
life has in times past been understood
to place upon married men. Positions are
found for women as stewardesses and in other
capacities, and it is coming to be increasingly
recognised that there is a large amount of
women's work to be done on board a ship.</p>

<p>By and by, when it is found that the best
and steadiest men can be secured by making
some little concessions to their desire for a
settled life and their objections to the crimp
and the "girl at every port," and all the other
squalid accessories so generally attached in the
popular mind to the seaman's career, there
will be a serious effort on the part of owners
to remodel the community on board of a ship
on the lines of a village. There will be the
"Ship's Shop" and the "Ship's School," the
"Ship's Church" and various other institutions
and societies.</p>

<p>Thus in the twentieth century the sea will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
no longer be regarded, to the same extent as
in the past, as the refuge for the ne'er-do-well
of the land-living populace; and this, more than
perhaps anything else, will help to render travelling
by the great ocean highways safe and
comfortable. It is a common complaint on
the part of owners that by far the larger part
of maritime disasters are directly traceable to
misconduct or neglect of duty on the part of
masters, officers or crew; but they have the
remedy in their own hands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>AGRICULTURE.</h3>


<p>Muscular power still carries out all the most
laborious work of the farm and of the garden&mdash;work
which, of course, consists, in the main,
of turning the land over and breaking up the
sods. In the operations of ploughing, harrowing,
rolling, and so forth, the agency almost
exclusively employed is the muscular power
of the horse guided by man-power; with the
accompaniment of a very large and exhausting
expenditure of muscular effort on the part of
the farmer or farm labourer. On the fruit
and vegetable garden the great preponderance
of the power usefully exercised must, under
existing conditions, come direct from the
muscles of men. Spade and plough represent
the badges of the rural workers' servitude, and
to rescue the country residents from this old-world
bondage must be one of the chief objects
to which invention will in the near future apply
itself.</p>

<p>The miner has to a very large extent escaped
from the thraldom of mere brute-work, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
hardening muscular effort. He drills the holes
in the face of the rock at which he is working
by means of compressed air or power conveyed
by the electric current; and then he performs
the work of breaking it down by the agency
of dynamite or some other high explosive.
Much heavy bodily labour, no doubt, remains
to be done by some classes of workers in
mines; but the significance of the march of
improvement is shown by the fact that a larger
and larger proportion of those who work under
the surface of the ground, or in ore-reduction
works, consists of men who are gradually
being enrolled among the ranks of the more
highly skilled and intelligent workers, whose
duty it is to understand and to superintend
pieces of mechanism driven by mechanical
power.</p>

<p>In farming and horticulture the field of labour is not so narrowly
localised as it is in mining. Work representing an expenditure of
hundreds of thousands of pounds may be carried out in mines whose area
does not exceed two or three acres; and it is therefore highly
remunerative to concentrate mechanical power upon such enterprises in
the most up-to-date machinery. But the farmer ranges from side to side
of his wide fields, covering hundreds, or even thousands, of acres with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
his operations. He is better situated than the miner in respect
of the economical and healthy application of horse-power, but far
worse in regard to the immediate possibilities of steam-power and
electrically-conducted energy. No one can feed draught stock more
cheaply than he, and no one can secure able-bodied men to work from
sunrise till evening at a lower wage.</p>

<p>Yet the course of industrial evolution, which
has made so much progress in the mine and
the factory, must very soon powerfully affect
agriculture. Already, in farming districts contiguous
to unlimited supplies of cheap power
from waterfalls, schemes have been set on
foot for the supply of power on co-operative
principles to the farmers of fertile land in
America, Germany, France, and Great Britain.
One necessity which will most materially aid
in spurring forward the movement for the
distribution of power for rural work is the
requirement of special means for lifting water
for irrigation, more particularly in those places
where good land lies very close to the area
that is naturally irrigable, by some scheme
already in operation but just a little too high.
Here it is seen at once that power means
fertility and consequent wealth, while the lack
of it&mdash;if the climate be really dry, as in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Pacific States of America&mdash;means loss and
dearth. But the presence of a source of power
which can easily be shifted about from place
to place on the farm for the purpose of watering
the ground must very soon suggest the
applicability of the same mechanical energy
to the digging or ploughing of the soil.</p>

<p>It is from this direction, rather than from
the wide introduction of steam-ploughs and
diggers, that the first great impetus to the
employment of mechanical power on the farm
may be looked for. The steam-plough, no
doubt, has before it a future full of usefulness;
and yet the slow progress that has been
made by it during a quarter of a century suggests
that, in its present form&mdash;that is to say
while built on lines imitating the locomotive
and the traction-engine&mdash;it cannot very successfully
challenge the plough drawn by horse-power.
More probable is it&mdash;as has already
been indicated&mdash;that the analogy of the rock-drill
in mining work will be followed. The
farmer will use an implement much smaller
and handier than a movable steam-engine, but
supplied with power from a central station,
either on his own land or in some place maintained
by co-operative or public agency. Just
as the miner pounds away at the rock by means
of compressed air or electricity, brought to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
hands through a pipe or a wire, so the farmer
will work his land by spades or ploughs by
the same kind of mechanical power. The
advantages of electrical transmission of energy
will greatly favour this kind of installation on
the farm, as compared with any other method
of distribution which is as yet in sight.</p>

<p>For the ploughing of a field by the electric
plough a cable will be required capable of
being stretched along one side of the area to
be worked. On this will run loosely a link or
wheel connected with another wire wound
upon a drum carried on the plough and paid
out as the latter proceeds across the field.
For different grades of land, of course, different
modes of working are advisable, the ordinary
plough of a multifurrow pattern, with stump-jumping
springs or weights, being used for
land which is not too heavy or clayey; a disc
plough or harrow being applicable to light,
well-worked ground; and the mechanical spade
or fork-digger&mdash;reciprocating in its motion
very much like the rock-drill&mdash;having its special
sphere of usefulness in wet and heavy land.
In any case a wide, gripping wheel is required
in front to carry the machine forward and to
turn it on reaching the end of the furrow.
The wire-wound drum is actuated by a spring
which tends to keep it constantly wound up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and when the plough has turned and is heading
again towards the cable at the side of the
field, this drum automatically winds up the
wire. So also when each pair of furrows has
been completed, the supply-wire is automatically
shifted along upon the fixed cable to a
position suitable for the next pair.</p>

<p>Not only in the working, but also in the
manuring, of the soil the electric current will
play an important part in the revolution in
agriculture. The fixing of the nitrogen from
the atmosphere in order to form nitrates available
as manure depends, from the physical
point of view, upon the creation of a sufficient
heat to set fire to it. The economic bearings
of this fact upon the future of agriculture,
especially in its relation to wheat-growing,
seemed so important to Sir William Crookes
that he made the subject the principal topic
of his Presidential Address before the British
Association in 1898.</p>

<p>The feasibility of the electrical mode of fixing
atmospheric nitrogen for plant-food has been
demonstrated by eminent electricians, the
famous Hungarian inventor, Nikola Tesla,
being among the foremost. The electric
furnace is just as readily applicable for forcing
the combination of an intractable element,
such as nitrogen, with other materials suitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
for forming a manurial base, as it is for making
calcium carbide by bringing about the union
of two such unsociable constituents as lime
and carbon.</p>

<p>Cheap power is, in this view, the great
essential for economically enriching the soil,
as well as for turning it over and preparing it
for the reception of seed. Nor is the fact a
matter of slight importance that this power
is specially demanded for the production of
an electric current for heating purposes, because
the transmission of such a current over
long distances to the places at which the
manurial product is required will save the
cost of much transport of heavy material.</p>

<p>The agricultural chemist and the microbiologist of the latter end of
the nineteenth century have laid considerable stress upon the
prospects of using the minute organisms which attach themselves to the
roots of some plants&mdash;particularly those of the leguminace&aelig;&mdash;as the
means of fixing the nitrogen of the atmosphere, and rendering it
available for the plant-food of cereals which are not endowed with the
faculty of encouraging those bacteria which fix nitrogen. High hopes
have been based upon the prospects of inoculating the soil over wide
areas of land with small quantities of sandy loam, taken from patches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
cultivated for leguminous plants which have been permitted to run to
seed, thus multiplying the nitrogen-fixing bacteria enormously. The
main idea has been to encourage the rapid production of these minute
organisms in places where they may be specially useful, but in which
they do not find a particularly congenial breeding ground.</p>

<p>The hope that any striking revolution may
be brought about in the practice of agriculture
by a device of this kind must be viewed in the
light of the fact that, while the scientists of
the nineteenth century have demonstrated,
partially at least, the true reason for the
beneficial effects of growing leguminous plants
upon soil intended to be afterwards laid down
in cereals, they were not by any means the
first to observe the fact that such benefits
accrued from the practice indicated. Several
references in the writings of ancient Greek and
Latin poets prove definitely that the good
results of a rotation of crops, regulated by the
introduction of leguminous plants at certain
stages, were empirically understood. In that
more primitive process of reasoning which
proceeds upon the assumption <i>post hoc, ergo
propter hoc</i>, the ancient agriculturist was a
past-master, and the chance of gleaning something
valuable from the field of common observation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
over which he has trod is not very great.</p>

<p>Modern improvements in agriculture will probably
be, in the main, such as are based upon
fundamental processes unknown to the ancients.
By the word "processes" it is intended
to indicate not those methods the scientific
reasons for which were understood&mdash;for these
in ancient times were very few&mdash;but simply
those which from long experience were noticed
to be beneficial. Good husbandry was in
olden times clearly understood to include the
practice of the rotation of crops, and the
beneficial results to be expected from the
introduction of those crops which are now
discovered to act as hosts to the microbes
which fix atmospheric nitrogen were not only
observed, but insisted upon.</p>

<p>From a scientific point of view this concurrence
of the results of ancient and of modern
observation may only serve to render the
bacteriology of the soil more interesting; but,
from the standpoint of an estimate of the
practical openings for agriculture improvements
in the near future, it greatly dwarfs the
prospect of any epoch-making change actually
founded upon the principle of the rotation of
crops. It is, indeed, conceivable that fresh
light on the life habits of the minute organisms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of the soil may lead to practical results quite
new; but hardly any such light is yet within
the inventor's field of vision.</p>

<p>This view of the limited prospects of practical
microbiology for the fixing of nitrogen in plant-food
was corroborated by Sir William Crookes
in the Presidential Address already cited. He
said that "practice has for a very long time
been ahead of science in respect of this department
of husbandry". For ages what is known
as the four course rotation had been practised,
the crops following one another in this order&mdash;turnips,
barley, clover and wheat&mdash;a sequence
which was popular more than two thousand
years ago. His summing up of the position
was to the effect that "our present knowledge
leads to the conclusion that the much more
frequent growth of clover on the same land,
even with successful microbe-seeding and
proper mineral supplies, would be attended
with uncertainties and difficulties, because the
land soon becomes what is called clover-sick,
and turns barren".</p>

<p>In regard to any practical application of
microbe-seeding, the farmers of the United
Kingdom at the end of the nineteenth century
had not, in the opinion of this eminent chemist,
reached even the experimental stage, although
on the Continent there had been some extension
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of microbe cultivation. To this it may
fairly be added that some of the attention
attracted to the subject on the Continent has
been due to the natural tendency of the German
mind to discover fine differences between things
which are not radically distinct. Under the
title of "microbe-cultivation" the long-familiar
practice of the rotation of crops may to some
continental enthusiasts seem to be quite an
innovation!</p>

<p>In the electrical manures-factory the operations
will be simply an enlargement of laboratory
experiments which have been familiar to
the chemist for many years. Moist air, kept
damp by steam, is traversed by strong electric
sparks from an induction coil inside of a bottle
or other liquor-tight receiver, and in a short
time it is found that in the bottom of this
receptacle a liquid has accumulated which,
on being tested, proves to be nitric acid. There
is also present a small quantity of ammonia
from the atmosphere. Nitrate of ammonia
thus formed would in itself be a manure; but,
of course, on the large scale other nitrates will
be formed by mixing the acid with cheap
alkalies which are abundant in nature, soda
from common salt, and lime from limestone.</p>

<p>In this process the excessive heat of the
electric discharge really raises the nitrogen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and oxygen of the atmosphere to a point of
temperature at which chemical union is forced; or, in other words,
the nitrogen is compelled to burn and to join in chemical combination
with the oxygen with which formerly it was only in mechanical mixture.
When nitrogen is burning, its flame is not in itself hot enough to
ignite contiguous volumes of the same element;&mdash;otherwise indeed
our atmosphere, after a discharge of lightning, would burn itself
out!&mdash;but the continuance of an electric discharge forces into
combination just a proportionate quantity of nitrogen. Practically,
therefore, manure in the future will mean electricity, and therefore
power; so that cheap sources of energy are of the greatest importance
to the farmer.</p>

<p>With dynamos driven by steam-engines, the
price of electrically-manufactured nitrate of
soda would, according to the estimate of Sir
William Crookes, be &pound;26 per ton, but at
Niagara, where water power is very cheap,
not more than &pound;5 per ton. Thus it will be seen
that the cheapness of power due to the presence
of the waterfall makes such a difference
in the economic aspects of the problem of the
electrical manufacture of manurial nitrates as
to reduce the price to less than one-fifth!
It must be remembered that at the close
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of the nineteenth century the electric installation
at Niagara is by very many persons
looked upon as being in itself in the nature of
an experiment, but at any rate there seems to
be no room for doubt that the cost of natural
power for electrical installations will very soon
be materially reduced. Even at the price
quoted, namely &pound;5 per ton, the cost of nitrate
of soda made with electrically combined atmospheric
nitrogen compares very favourably
with commercial nitrates as now imported for
agriculture purposes. "Chili nitrate," in fact,
is about fifty per cent. dearer.</p>

<p>When wave-power and other forms of the
stored energy of the wind have been properly
harnessed in the service of mankind, the region
around Niagara will only be one of thousands
of localities at which nitrogenous manures
can be manufactured electrically at a price far
below the present cost of natural deposits of
nitrate of soda. From the power stations all
around the coasts, as well as from those on
waterfalls and windy heights among the mountains,
electric cables will be employed to convey
the current for fixing the nitrogen of the
air at places where the manures are most
wanted.</p>

<p>The rediscovery of the art of irrigation is
one of the distinguishing features of modern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
industrial progress in agriculture. Extensive
ruins and other remains in Assyria, Egypt,
India, China and Central America prove beyond
question that irrigation played a vastly
more important part in the industrial life of
the ancients than it does in that of modern
mankind. This is true in spite of the fact that
power and dominion ultimately fell to the lot
of those races which originally dwelt in colder
and more hilly or thickly-wooded regions, where
the instincts of hunting and of warfare were
naturally developed, so that, by degrees, the
peoples who understood irrigation fell under
the sway of those who neither needed nor appreciated
it. In the long interval vast forests
have been cleared away and the warlike habits
of the northern and mountainous races have
been greatly modified, but manufacturing progress
among them has enabled them to perpetuate
the power originally secured by the
bow and the spear. The irrigating races of
mankind are now held in fear of the modern
weapons which are the products of the iron
and steel industries, just as they were thousands
of years ago terrorised by the inroads of the
wild hunting men from the North.</p>

<p>But the future of agriculture will very largely
belong to a class of men who will combine in
themselves the best attributes of the irrigationist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and the man who knows how to use
the iron weapon and the iron implement. As
the manufacturing supremacy of the North
becomes more and more assured by reason
of the superior healthiness of a climate encouraging
activity of muscle and brain, so the
agricultural prospects of the warmer regions
of the earth's surface will be improved by the
comparative immunity of plant and of animal
life from disease in a dry atmosphere. Sheep,
cattle and horses thrive far better in a climate
having but a scanty rainfall than in one having
an abundance of wet; and so, also, does the
wheat plant when the limited rains happen
to be timed to suit its growth, and the best
kinds of fruit trees when the same conditions
prevail.</p>

<p>All this points to an immense recrudescence
of irrigation in the near future. Already the
Californians and other Americans of the Pacific
Slope have demonstrated that irrigation is a
practice fully as well suited to the requirements
of a thoroughly up-to-date people as it has
been for long ages to those of the "unchanging
East". But here again the question of cheap
power obtrudes itself. The Chinese, Hindoos
and Egyptians have long ago passed the stage
at which the limited areas which were irrigable
by gravitation, without advanced methods of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
engineering, have been occupied; and the
lifting of water for the supplying of their
paddy fields has been for thousands of years a
laborious occupation for the poorest and most
degraded of the rural population.</p>

<p>In a system of civilisation in which transport
costs so little as it does in railway and steam-ship
freights, the patches of territory which
can be irrigated by water brought by gravitation
from the hills or from the upper reaches
of rivers are comparatively easy of access to a
market. This fact retards the advent of the
time when colossal installations for the throwing
of water upon the land will be demanded.
When that epoch arrives, as it assuredly will
before the first half of the twentieth century
has been nearly past, the pumping plants devoted
to the purposes of irrigation will present
as great a contrast to the lifting appliances of
the East as does a fully loaded freight train or
a mammoth steam cargo-slave to a coolie
carrier.</p>

<p>At the same time there must inevitably be
a great extension of the useful purposes to
which small motors can be applied in irrigation.
Year by year the importance of the sprinkler,
not only for ornamental grounds such as lawns
and flower-beds, but also for the vegetable
patch and the fruit garden, becomes more apparent,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and efforts are being made towards
the enlargement of the arms of sprinkling contrivances
to such an extent as to enable them
to throw a fine shower of water over a very
large area of ground. Sometimes a windmill
is used for pumping river or well-water
into high tanks from which it descends by
gravitation into the sprinklers, the latter being
operated by the power of the liquid as it descends.
This mode of working is convenient
in many cases; but a more important, because
a more widely applicable, method in the future
will be that in which the wind-motor not only
lifts the water, but scatters it around in the
same operation. Long helical-shaped screws,
horizontally fixed between uprights or set on
a swivel on a single high tower, can be used
for loading the breeze with a finely divided
shower of water and thus projecting the moisture
to very long distances. A windmill of
the ordinary pattern, as used for gardens, may
be fitted with a long perforated pipe, supported
by wire guys instead of a vane, a connection
being made by a water-tight swivel-joint between
this pipe and that which carries the
liquid from the pump. In this way every
stroke of the machine sends innumerable jets
of water out upon the wind, to be carried far
afield.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Gardening properties in comparatively dry
climates, fitted with machines of this description,
can be laid out in different zones of cultivation,
determined according to the prevailing
directions of the wind and the consequent distribution
of the water supply. Thus if the wind
most frequently blows from the west the plants
which require the most water must be laid out
at the eastern side, not too far from the sprinkler.
Facilities for shutting off the supply of spray
at will are, of course, very necessary. The
system of watering founded on this principle
depends upon the assumption that if the
gardener or the farmer could always turn on
the rain when he has a fairly good wind he
would never lack for seasonable moisture to
nourish his crops. This will be found in practice
to apply correctly to the great majority
of food plants. In the dry climates, which are
so eminently healthy for cereals, "the early and
the latter rains," as referred to in Scripture, are
both needed, and one of the most important applications
of cheap power will be directed to
supplementing the natural supply either at one
end or at the other.</p>

<p>The "tree-doctor" will be a personage of
increasing importance in the rural economy
of the twentieth century. He is already well
in sight; but for lack of capital and of a due
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
appreciation of the value of his services, he
occupies as yet but a comparatively subordinate
position. Fruits, which are nature's most elaborately
worked-up edible products, must come
more and more into favour as the complement
to the seed food represented by bread. As
the demand increases it will be more clearly
seen that an enormous waste of labour is involved
in the culture of an orchard unless its
trees are kept in perfect health. At the same
time the law of specialization must operate to
set aside the tree-doctor to his separate duties,
just as the physician and the veterinary surgeon
already find their own distinctive spheres of
work. The apparatus required for the thorough
eradication of disease in fruit trees will be too
expensive for the average grower to find any
advantage in buying it for use only a few times
during the year; but the tree-doctor, with his
gangs of men, will be able to keep his special
appliances at work nearly all the year round.</p>

<p>For the destruction of almost all classes of
fruit-pests, the only really complete method
now in sight is the application of a poisonous
gas, such as hydrocyanic acid, which is retained
by means of a gas-proof tent pitched around
each tree. No kind of a spray or wash can
penetrate between bark and stem or into the
cavities on fruit so well as a gaseous insecticide
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
which permeates the whole of the air within
the included space. But the gas-tight tent
system of fumigation is as yet only in its infancy,
and its growth and development will
greatly help to place the fruit-growing industry
on a new basis, and to bring the best kinds of
fruit within the reach of the middle classes,
the artisans, and ultimately even the very poor.
Just as wheaten bread from being a luxury
reserved for the rich has become the staple of
food for all grades of society, so fruits which
are now commonly regarded as an indulgence,
although a very desirable addition to the food
of the well-to-do, must, in a short time, become
practically a necessity to the great mass of the
people generally.</p>

<p>The waste of effort and of wealth involved
in planting trees and assiduously cultivating
the soil for the growth of poor crops decimated
by disease is the prime cause of the
dearness of fruit. If, therefore, it be true
that the fruit diet is one which is destined to
greatly improve the average health of civilised
mankind, it is obvious that the tree-doctor
will act indirectly as the physician for human
ailments. When this fact has been fully realised
the public estimation in which economic
entomology and kindred sciences are held will
rise very appreciably, and the capital invested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in complete apparatus for fighting disease in
tree life will be enormously increased.</p>

<p>Very long tents, capable of covering not merely one tree each, but of
including continuous rows stretching perhaps from end to end of a
large orchard, will become practically essential for up-to-date
fruit-culture. An elongated tent of this description, covering a row
of trees, may be filled with fumes from a position at the end of the
row, where a generating plant on a trolley may be situated. At the
opposite end another trolley is stationed, and each movable vehicle
carries an upright mast or trestle for the support of the strong cable
which passes along the row over the tops of the trees and is stretched
taut by suitable contrivances. Attached to this cable is a flexible
tube containing a number of apertures and connected at the generating
station with the small furnace or fumigating box from which the
poisonous gases emanate.</p>

<p>Along the ground at each side of the row
are stretched two thinner wires or cables
which hold the long tent securely in position.
The method of shifting from one row to another
is very simple. Both trolleys are moved into
their new positions at the two ends of a fresh
row, the fastenings of the tent at the ground on
the further side having been released, so that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the flap of the tent on that side is dragged over
the tops of the trees and may then be drawn
over the top cable and down upon the other
side. Seen from the end, the movements of
the tent thus resemble those of a double-hinged
trestle in the form of an inverted V which
advances by having one leg flung over the
other. For this arrangement of a fumigating
tent it is best that the top cable should consist
of a double wire, the fabric of the tent itself
being gripped between the two wires, and a
flexible tube being attached to each.</p>

<p>As progress is made from one row to another
through the drawing of one flap over the other,
it is obvious that the tent turns inside out at
each step, and if only one cable and one tube
were used, it would be difficult to avoid permitting
the gas to escape into the outer air at
one stage or another. But when the tubes
are duplicated in the manner described, there
is always one which is actually within the tent
no matter what position the latter may be in.
It is then only necessary that the connection
with the generating apparatus at the end of
the row should be made after each movement
with the tube which is inside the tent. For
very long rows of trees the top cable needs to
be supported by intermediate trestles besides
the uprights at the ends.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
The gas and air-proof tent can be used for various other purposes
besides those of killing pests on fruit trees. One of the regular
tasks of the tree-doctor will be connected with the artificial
fertilisation of trees on the wholesale scale and for a purpose such
as this it is necessary that the trees to be operated upon shall not
be open to the outside atmosphere, but that the pollen dust, with
which the air inside the tent is to be laden, shall be strictly
confined during a stated period of time. Those methods of
fertilisation, with which the flower-gardener has in recent years
worked such wonders, can undoubtedly be utilised for many objects
besides those of the variation of form and hue in ornamental plants.</p>

<h3>MINING.</h3>


<p>Exploratory telegraphy seems likely to claim
a position in the twentieth century economics
of mining, its particular r&ocirc;le being to aid in
the determination of the "strike" of mineral-bearing
lodes. One main reason for this conclusion
consists in the fact that the formations
which carry metalliferous ores are nearly always
more moist than the surrounding country, and
are therefore better conductors of the electrical
current. Indeed there is good ground for the
belief that this moistness of the fissures and
lodes in which metals chiefly occur has been
in part the original cause of the deposition of
those metals from their aqueous solutions percolating
along the routes in which gravitation
carries them. In the volumes of <i>Nature</i> for
1890 and 1891 will be found communications
in which the present writer has set forth some
of the arguments tending to strengthen the
hypothesis that earth-currents of electricity
exercise an appreciable influence in determining
the occurrence of gold and silver, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
they have probably been to some extent instrumental
in settling the distribution of other
metals.</p>

<p>The existence of currents of electricity
passing through the earth's crust and on its
surface along the lines of least resistance has
long been an established fact. Experiments
conducted at Harvard, U.S.A., by Professor
Trowbridge have proved beyond a doubt that, by
means of such delicate apparatus as the telephone
and microphone, it is possible for the
observer to state in which direction, from a
given point, the best line of conductivity runs.
Under certain conditions the return current
is so materially facilitated when brought along
the line of a watercourse or a moist patch of
the earth's crust, that the words heard through
a telephone are distinctly more audible than
they are at a similar distance when there is
no moist return circuit. Deflections of the
compass, due to the passing of earth-currents
along the natural lines of conductivity in the
soil or the rocks, are so frequently noticed as
to be a source of calculation to the scientific
surveyor and astronomer. It can thus be
shown not only that definite lines of least
electrical resistance exist in the earth, but also
that natural currents of greater or less strength
are almost constantly passing along these lines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Some of the curious and puzzling empirical
rules gained from the life-long experience of
miners in regard to the varying richness and
poorness of mineral lodes, according to the
directions in which they strike&mdash;whether north,
south, east or west&mdash;may very probably be
explained, and to some extent justified, by the
fuller light which science may throw upon
the conditions determining the action of earth-currents
in producing results similar to those
of electro deposition. If, in a given region of
a mineral-bearing country, the geological formation
is such as to lend itself to the easy
conduction of currents in one direction rather
than in another, the phenomenon referred to
may perhaps be partially explained. But, on
the other hand, the origin of the generating
force which sets the currents in motion must
first be studied before the true conditions determining
their direction can be understood.
In other words, much that is now obscure,
including the true origin of the earth's magnetism,
must be to some extent cleared up before
the reasons for the seemingly erratic strike of
earth-currents and of richness in mineral lodes
can be fully explained.</p>

<p>Practice, however, may here get some distance
ahead of science, and may indeed lend
some assistance to the latter by providing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
empirical data upon which it may proceed.
When once it is clearly seen that by delicate
electrical instruments, such as the telephone,
the microphone and the coherer as used in
wireless telegraphy, the line of least resistance
on any given area of the earth's surface or any
given piece of its crust may be determined,
the bearing of that fact in showing the best
lines of moisture and therefore the likeliest
lines for mineral lodes will soon be recognised
in a very practical manner.</p>

<p>No class of men is keener or more enterprising
in its applications of the latest practical
science to the getting of money than mining
speculators. Nor have they at all missed
the significance of moist bands occurring in
any underground workings as a very favourable
augury for the close approach of highly
mineralised lodes. If, then, moisture be favourable,
first to the presence of mineral-bearing
country and secondly to the conductivity of
electrical lines, it is obvious that there is a
hopeful field for the exercise of ingenuity in
bringing the one into a practical relation to
the other.</p>

<p>The occult scientific reasons for the connection
may not be understood; but it is sufficient
for practical purposes to know that, in a
certain line from the surface outcropping of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
mineral lode, there has been given a demonstration
of less electrical resistance along that
line than is experienced in any other direction;
also to know that such a line of least resistance
is proved to have been, in almost innumerable
instances, coincident with the best line of
mineral-bearing country. The case is similar
to that of the rotation of crops in its relation
to scientific microbiology. The art of mining
may get ahead of the science of physiography
in respect of earth-currents and lines of least
resistance, as showing where mineral lodes may
be expected. Yet there is no doubt whatever
that science will not in the one case lag so far
behind as it has done in the other.</p>

<p>The first notable service rendered by systems
of the kind indicated will no doubt be in connection
with the rediscovery of very valuable
lodes which have been followed up for certain
distances and then lost. In an instance of
this description much fruitless exploration
drives, winzes and "jump-ups" may have been
carried out in the surrounding country rock
near the place where the lode last "cut out";
but, in the absence of anything to guide the
mine manager and surveyor as to the direction
which the search should take, nothing but
loss has been involved in the quest. Several
properties in the same neighbourhood have,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
perhaps, been abandoned or suspended in
operation owing to very similar causes.</p>

<p>The whole group may perhaps have then
been bought by an exploration company whose
<i>modus operandi</i> will be as follows: The terminal
of the electrical exploration plant is fixed
at the end of the lode where it gave out, or
else immersed in the water of the shaft which
is in connection with the lode system; and
another similar terminal is fixed by turns in
each shaft of the contiguous group. The electrical
resistances offered to the return currents,
or to the wireless vibrations, are then carefully
measured; and the direction of the lost lode
is taken to be that which shows the least resistance
in proportion to the distance traversed.
The work of carrying out such an investigation
must of necessity be somewhat elaborate,
because it may be necessary to connect in
turn each shaft, as a centre, with every one of
the others as subsidiaries. But the guidance
afforded even of a negative character, resulting
in the avoidance of useless cutting and blasting
through heavy country, will prove invaluable.</p>

<p>Many matters will require attention, in following
out such a line of practical investigation,
which are to some extent foreign to the usual
work of the mining engineer. For example,
the conditions which determine the "short-circuiting"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of an earth-current require to be
carefully noted, because it would be fallacious
to reason that because the line of least resistance
lay in a certain direction, therefore an
almost continuous lode would be found. Moreover,
the electrical method must only be relied
upon as a guide when carefully checked by
other considerations. Other kinds of moist
formations, both metalliferous and non-metalliferous,
may influence the lines of least electrical
resistance, besides those containing the
particular metal which is being sought for.</p>

<p>The water difficulty has enforced the abandonment
of very many valuable mines in which
the positions of the lodes are still well known.
Sunken riches lying beneath the sea in old
Spanish galleons have excited the cupidity
and the ingenuity of speculators and engineers;
but the total amount of wealth thus hidden
away from view is a mere insignificant fraction
of the value of the rich metalliferous lodes
which lie below the water level in flooded
mines.</p>

<p>The point in depth at which the accumulation
of the water renders further following of
the lode impracticable may vary in different
countries. In China, throughout whole provinces,
there is hardly a mine to be found in
which the efforts of the miners have not been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
absolutely paralyzed directly the water-level
was reached. But in Western lands, as well
as in South Africa and Australia, the immense
capacity of the pumps employed for keeping
down the water has enabled comparatively
wet ground to be worked to a very considerable
depth.</p>

<p>The limit, nevertheless, has been reached in
many rich mining districts. Pumps of the
most approved type, and driven by the largest
and most economical steam-engines, have done
their best in the struggle against the difficulty;
and yet the water has beaten them. Rich as
are the lodes which lie beneath the water, the
mining engineer is compelled to confess that
the metal value which they contain would not
leave, after extraction, a sufficient margin to
pay for the enormous cost of draining the
shafts. In some instances, indeed, it remains
exceedingly doubtful whether pumps of the
largest capacity ever attained in any part of
the world would cope with the task entailed
in draining the abandoned shafts. The underground
workings have practically tapped subterranean
rivers which, to all intents and
purposes, are inexhaustible. Or it may be
that the mine has penetrated into some hollow
basin of impermeable strata filled only with
porous material which is kept constantly saturated.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
To drain such a piece of country would
mean practically the emptying of a lake.</p>

<p>Subaqueous mining is therefore one of the
big problems which the mining engineer of
the twentieth century must tackle. To a certain
extent he will receive guidance in his difficult
task from the experiences of those who have
virtually undertaken submarine mining when
in search of treasure lost in sunken ships. The
two methods of pumping and of subaqueous
mining will in some places be carried out
conjointly.</p>

<p>In such instances the work assigned to the
pumping machinery will be to keep free of
water those drives in which good bodies of
ore were exposed when last profitable work
was being carried on. All below that level
will be permitted to fill with water, and the
work of boring by means of compressed air, of
blasting out the rock and of filling the trucks,
will all be performed under the surface. For
the shallower depths large tanks, open at the
top, will be constructed and slung upon trucks
run on rails along the lowest drives. Practically
this arrangement means that an iron
shaft, closed at the sides and bottom, and
movable on rails laid above the surface, will
be employed to keep the water out. Somewhat
similar appliances have been found very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
useful in the operations for laying the foundations
of bridges.</p>

<p>The details requiring to be worked out for
the successful working of subaqueous systems
of mining are numerous and important. Chief
among these must be the needful provision for
enabling the miner to see through strong glass
windows near the bottom of the iron shaft, by
the aid of electric lights slung in the water outside,
and thus to estimate the correct positions
at which to place his drills and his explosives.
For this reason the work of the day must be
systematically divided so that at stated intervals
the clay and other materials held in suspension
by the disturbed water may be allowed to settle
and the water be made comparatively clear.</p>

<p>Specially constructed strainers for the
mechanical filtration of the water near the ore
face, and probably, also, chemical and other
precipitates, will be largely resorted to for
facilitating this important operation. Beside
each window will be provided strong flexible
sleeves, terminating in gloves into which the
miner can place his hands for the purpose of
adjusting the various pieces of machinery required.
Beyond this, of course, every possible
application of mechanical power operated from
above will be resorted to, not only for drilling,
but also for gripping and removing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
shattered pieces of rock and ore resulting
from the blasting operations.</p>

<p>From the unwatered drive or tunnel downwards,
the method of working as just described
may be characterised as an underground application
of the "open-cut system". No elaborate
honeycombing of the country below the water-level
will be economically possible as it is when
working in dry rock. But then, again, it is becoming
plain to many experts in mining that, in
working downwards from the surface itself, the
future of their industry offers a wide field for
the extension of the open-cut system. In
proportion as power becomes cheaper, the expense
attendant upon the removal of clay, sand,
and rock for the purpose of laying bare the
cap of a lode at a moderate depth becomes
less formidable when balanced against the
economy introduced by methods which admit
of the miner working in the open air, although
at the bottom of a kind of deep quarry. While
the system of close mining will hold its own
in a very large number of localities, still there
are other places where the increasing cheapness
of power for working an open-cut and
the coincident increase in the scarcity and
cost of timber for supporting the ground, will
gradually shift the balance of advantage on to
the side of the open method.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
At the same time great improvements are
now foreshadowed in regard to the modes of
working mines by shafts and drives. Some
shafts will in future be worked practically as
the vertical portions of tramways, having endless
wire ropes to convey the trucks direct
from the face or the stope to the reduction
works, and thus an immense saving will be
effected in the costs incidental to mining.
From the neighbourhood of the place at which
it has been won, the ore will be drawn in
trucks, attached to the endless wire rope, first
along the drive on the horizontal, and then up
an incline increasing in sharpness till the shaft
is reached, where the direction of motion becomes
vertical. Near the surface, again, there
is an incline, gradually leading to the level of
the ground, or rather of the elevated tramway
from which the stuff is to be tipped into the
mill, or, if it be mullock, on to the waste heap.
The return of each truck is effected along the
reverse side of the endless wire-rope cable.</p>

<p>Ventilation is an incidental work of much
importance which it becomes more practicable
to carry out in a satisfactory manner when an
endless system of truck conveyance has been
provided, reaching from the ore-face to the mill,
and thence back again. The reason is mainly
that the same routes which have been prepared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
for this traffic are available for the supply of
air and for the return current which must carry
off the accumulated bad gases from the underground
workings. Fans, operated by the cable
at various places along the line of communication,
keep up a brisk exchange of air, and the
coming and going of the trucks themselves
help to maintain a good, healthy atmosphere,
even in the most remote parts of the mine.
In very deep mines, where the heat becomes
unbearable after a few minutes unless a strong
wind be kept going underground, the forward
and backward courses for traffic and ventilation
together are specially advantageous.</p>

<p>Prices during the twentieth century will
depend more definitely upon the cost of gold-mining
than they have ever done at any former
time in the world's history. In spite of all the
opposition which fanaticism and ignorance
could offer to the natural trend of events in
the commercial and financial life of the world,
the gold standard now rests on an impregnable
base; and every year witnesses some new
triumph for those who accept it as the foundation
of the civilised monetary system. This
being the case, it is obvious that the conditions
affecting the production of gold must possess
a very peculiar interest even for those who
have never lived within hundreds of miles of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
any gold mine. To all intents and purposes
the habit of every man is to measure daily and
even hourly the value of his efforts at producing
what the economist calls "utilities," against
those of the gold miner.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the latter successfully calls to
his aid mechanical giants who render his work
easier and who enable him to throw into the
world's markets a larger proportion of gold
for a given amount of effort, the result must
be that the price of gold must fall, or, in other
words, the prices of general commodities must
rise. If, on the other hand, all other industries
have been subjected to the like improved conditions
of working, the effect must be to that
extent to balance the rise and keep prices
comparatively steady.</p>

<p>From this point of view it will be seen that
the interests of all those who desire to see a
rise in general prices are to a large extent
bound up in the improvement of methods for
the extraction of gold. The question of cheap
power does not by any means monopolise the
data upon which such a problem can be provisionally
decided; and yet it may be broadly
stated that in the main the increased output
of gold in the future depends upon the more
economical production and application of
power. Measured against other commodities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
which also depend mainly upon the same
factor, gold will probably remain very steady;
while, in contrast with those things which
require for the production taste and skill rather
than mere brute force or mechanical power,
gold will fall in value. In other words, the
classes of articles and services depending upon
the exercise of man's higher faculties of skill,
taste, and mental power will rise in price.</p>

<p>Getting gold practically means, in modern
times, crushing stone. This statement is subject
to fewer and fewer exceptions from one
decade to another, according as the alluvial
deposits in the various gold-producing countries
become more or less completely worked out.
A partial revival of alluvial mining has been
brought about through the application of the
giant dredger to cheapening the process of
extracting exceedingly small quantities of
gold from alluvial drift and dirt. Yet on the
whole it will be found that the gold-mining
industry, almost all the world over, is getting
down to the bed-rock of ore-treatment by
crushing and by simple methods of separation.
Thus practically we may say that the cost of
gold is the cost of power in those usually secluded
localities where the precious metal is
found in quantities sufficient to tempt the
investment of capital.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
From this it may be inferred that the cheap
transmission of power by the electric current
will effect a more profound revolution in the
gold-mining industry than in almost any other.
The main deterrent to the investing of money
in opening up a new gold mine consists in the
fact that a very large and certain expense is
involved in the conveyance of heavy machinery
to the locality, while the results are very largely
in the nature of a lottery. When, however,
the power is supplied from a central station,
and when economical types of crusher are
more fully introduced, this deterrent will, to
a large extent, disappear. The cables which
radiate from the central electric power-house
in all directions can be very readily devoted to
the furnishing of power to new mines as soon
as it is found that the older ones have been
proved unprofitable.</p>

<p>No one will think of carrying ore to the
power when it is far more economical and
profitable to carry power to the ore. In this
connection the principle of the division of
labour becomes very important. In its bearing
upon the mining industry generally, whether
in its application to the precious metals or to
those which are termed the baser, and even in
the work of raising coal and other non-metalliferous
minerals, the fact that nearly all mines
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
occur in groups will greatly aid in determining
the separation of the work of supplying
power, as a distinct industry from that of
mining.</p>

<p>Ore-dressing is an art which was in a very
rudimentary state at the middle of the nineteenth
century, when the great discoveries of
gold, silver and other metals began to influence
the world's markets in so striking a manner.
The ancients used the jigger in the form of a
wicker basket filled with crushed ore and
jerked by hand up and down in water for the
purpose of causing the lighter parts to rise to
the top, while the more valuable portions made
their way to the bottom. In this way the
copper mines of Spain were worked in the
days of the Roman Empire, and probably the
system had existed from time immemorial.</p>

<p>Fifty or sixty years ago the miner had got
so far as to hitch his jigging basket or sieve on
to some part of his machinery, generally his
pumping engine, and thus to avoid the wearing
muscular effort involved in moving it in the
water by hand. It was not until the obvious
mistake of using a machine which permitted
the finest, and sometimes the richest, parts of
the ore to escape had been for many years
ineffectually admitted, that the "vanner," or
moving endless band with a stream of water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
running on it, was invented with the special
object of treating the finer stuff.</p>

<p>Jiggers and vanners form the staple of the
miner's ore-dressing machinery at the present
day. The efficiency of the latter class of
separating machines, working on certain kinds
of finely crushed ore, is already so great that
it may be said without exaggeration that it
could hardly be much improved upon, so far
as percentage of extraction is concerned; and
yet the waste of power which is involved is
something outrageous. For the treatment of
a thin layer of slimes, perhaps no thicker than
a sixpence, it is necessary to violently agitate,
with a reciprocating movement, a large and
heavy framework. Sometimes the quantity
of stuff put through as the result of one horse-power
working for an hour is not more than
about a hundredweight. The consequence
is that in large mines the nests of vanners
comprise scores or even hundreds of machines.
When shaking tables are used, without the
addition of the endless moving bands, good
work can also be done; but the waste of power
is still excessive.</p>

<p>The vanning spade and shallow washing
dish are the prototypes of this kind of ore-dressing
machinery. Let any one place a line
of finely-crushed wet ore on a flat spade and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
draw the latter quickly through still water, at
the same time shaking it, and the result on
inspection, if the speed has not been so great
as to sweep all the fine grains off the surface,
will be that the heavier parts of the
ore will be found to have ranged themselves
on the side towards which the spade was propelled
in its progress through the water. A
sheet of glass serves for the purpose of this
experiment even better than a metal implement;
but the spade is the time-honoured appliance
among miners for testing some kinds
of finely crushed ore by mechanical separation.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that, besides the shaking
motion imparted to the apparatus, the only
active agency in the distribution of the particles
is the sidelong movement of the spade relatively
to the water. But it makes little or no difference
whether the water moves sidelong on
the spade or the latter progresses through the
liquid; the ore will range itself accurately
all the same. Consequently, if a circular tank
be used, and if the water be set in rotary
motion, the ore on a sheet of glass, held steady,
will arrange itself in the same way. If the
ore be fed in small streams of water down the
inclined surfaces of sloping glass, or other
smooth shelves set close to and parallel with
one another near the periphery of such a vessel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
of moving water, the resultant motions of the
heavy and of the light particles respectively,
in passing down these shelves, will be found
to be so different that the good stuff can be
caught by a receptacle placed at one part, while
the tailings fall into another receiver which is
differently situated at the place where the
lighter grains fall.</p>

<p>The main essential in this particular application
of the art of vanning is simply that the
water should move or drift transversely to
lines of ore passing, while held in suspension
with water, down a smooth sloping surface.
In dealing with some very light classes of ore,
and especially such as may naturally crush
very fine&mdash;that is to say, with a large proportion
of impalpable "slimes"&mdash;there is a decided
advantage in causing the water to drift sidelong
on the smooth shelf by other means than
the motion in a circular tank.</p>

<p>Adopting nearly the form of the "side delivery
manner," in which the moving band is
canted to the side and the stuff runs off sideways,
the sloping smooth shelf can be worked
for ore separation with merely the streams of
water holding the fine sand in suspension
running down at fixed intervals. A glass
covering is placed very close to this surface
on which the streams run; and between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
two is driven laterally a strong current of wind
by means of a blast-fan, which causes each
stream of water to drift a little sidewards,
carrying with it the lighter particles, but leaving
on its windward side a line of nearly pure ore.
These small runlets can be multiplied, on a
shelf measuring six or eight feet in length, to
such an extent that the machine can put
through as much ore as a dozen vanners, consuming
only a mere fraction of the power
necessary to drive one machine of the older
type.</p>

<p>Cyanide solution, instead of water, is very
advantageously employed for this kind of
operation in the case of extracting gold from
crushed ore. The method is to pump the
liquid from the tanks in which it is stored
and to allow it to flow back by way of the
vanning apparatus, thus providing not only for
catching the grains of gold by the concentrating
machine, but also for the dissolving of the fine
impalpable gold dust, or natural precipitate,
by the action of the cyanide of potassium.</p>

<p>Upon the use of this latter chemical will be
based the main improvements in the gold-mining
industry during the twentieth century;
and, conversely, the applications of the old
system of amalgamating with mercury, in order
to catch the golden particles, will be gradually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
restricted. Fine concentrators, worked with
cyanide solution, perform three operations at
once, namely, first, the catching of the free
gold grains; second, the production of a rich
concentrate of minerals having gold in association
and intended for smelting; and, third,
the dissolving of the finest particles by the
continual action of the chemical.</p>

<p>In fact it is in the treatment of complex and
very refractory ores generally, whether of the
precious or of the baser metals, that the finer
applications of the art of the ore-dresser will
receive their first great impetus. The vanner,
as well as the jigger, will become an instrument
of precision; and in combination with rushing
appliances operated by cheap power in almost
unlimited quantities it will materially assist
in multiplying the world's supply of metals.
This again will aid in promoting the further
extension of machinery. Gold will be produced
in greater abundance for what is called the
machinery of commerce; and the base metals,
particularly the new alloys of steel and also
copper and aluminium, will be more largely produced
for engineering and electrical purposes.</p>

<p>The importation&mdash;particularly to England and
Scotland&mdash;of large quantities of highly-concentrated iron ore
will cause one of the first notable developments in the mining and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
ore-treatment of the twentieth century so far as the United Kingdom is
concerned. The urgent necessity for an extension in the manufacture of
Bessemer steel, and of the new and remarkable alloys in which very
small quantities of other metals are employed in order to impart
altogether exceptional qualities to iron, must accentuate the demand
for those kinds of ore which lend themselves most readily to the
special requirements of the works on hand. Hence the question of the
transport of special kinds of iron ore over longer distances will have
to be faced (as it has been already to a limited degree), and not only
in reference to ores containing a low percentage of phosphorus and
therefore exceptionally suitable for the Bessemerising process, but
also in regard to ores which are amenable to magnetic separation.</p>

<p>Magnetite, indeed, must bulk more largely
in the future as a source of iron, particularly
because it is susceptible of magnetic separation,
a process which as yet is only in its infancy.
Containing, as it does, a larger percentage of
iron than any other source from which the
metal is commercially extracted, its employment
as an ore results in great economy of
fuel, as well as a reduction in the proportionate
costs of transport. When ores of iron require
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
to be brought from oversea places, it is obvious
that those which will concentrate to the purest
product possible, and which are in other respects
specially applicable to the production
of grades of steel of exceptional tensile strength,
will have the preference.</p>

<p>Magnetic concentration, or the separation of
an ore from the waste gangue by the attraction
of powerful electro-magnets, must therefore
occupy a much more prominent place in the
metallurgy of the future than it has in that of
the past. Not only may ironstone containing
magnetite be separated from other material,
but several important minerals acquire the property
of becoming magnetic when subjected to
the operation of roasting, sometimes through a
sulphide being converted into a magnetic oxide.</p>

<p>By the use of powerful electro-magnets, the
poles of which are brought to a point or to a
nearly sharp knife-edge, the intensity of the
magnetic field can be so enormously increased
that even minerals which are only feebly magnetic
can readily be separated by being lifted
away from the non-magnetic material. In
some systems the crushed ore is simply permitted
to fall in a continuous stream through
a strong magnetic field, and the magnetic
particles are diverted out of the vertical in
their descent by the operation of the magnets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Nor is it only those minerals that actually
become themselves magnetic on being roasted
which can be so differentiated from the material
with which they are associated as to be amenable
to magnetic separation. Even differences
in hygroscopic properties&mdash;that is to say, in
the degree of avidity with which a mineral
takes up moisture from the atmosphere&mdash;may
be made available for the purpose of effecting
a commercially valuable separation. This is
especially the case with some complex ores in
which one constituent, on being roasted, acquires
a much greater hygroscopic power than
the others, the grains of the crushed and roasted
ore becoming damp and sticky while those
of the other minerals remain comparatively
dry. By mixing with an ore of this kind&mdash;after
it has been allowed to "weather" for a
short time&mdash;some finely-powdered magnetite
the strongly hygroscopic constituents can be
made practically magnetic, because the magnetic
impalpable dust adheres to them, while
it remains separate from the grains of the
other minerals.</p>

<p>Hardness&mdash;as well as magnetic attraction&mdash;is
a property of ore which has as yet been
made available to only a very slight extent
as the basis of a system of separation. If a
quantity of mixed fragments of glass and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
plumbago be pounded together in a mortar
with only a moderate degree of pressure, so as
to avoid, as far as possible, the breaking of the
glass, there will soon come a stage at which
the softer material can be separated from the
harder simply by means of a fine sieve. There
are many naturally-existing mineral mixtures
in the crushing of which a similar result occurs
in a very marked degree; and, indeed, there
are none which do not show the peculiarity
more or less, because the constituents of an
ore are never of exactly the same degree of
hardness. When the worthless parts are the
softer and therefore have the greater tendency
to "slime," the ore is very readily dressed to
a high percentage by means of water.</p>

<p>But when the reverse is the case, and the
valuable constituents through their softness
get reduced to a fine pulp long before the
other parts, the ordinary operations of the
ore-dresser become much more difficult to carry
out. Most elaborate ore-reduction plants are
constructed with the view to causing the crushing
surfaces, whether of rolls or of jaws, to
merely tap each piece of stone so as to break
it in bits without creating much dust. This
operation is repeated over and over again; but
the stuff which is fine enough to go to the
concentrator is removed by sieving after each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
operation of the kind; and the successive
rolls or other crushers are set to a finer and
finer gauge, so that there is a progressive
approach to the conditions of coarse sand,
which is that specially desired by the ore-dresser.</p>

<p>Much of this elaboration will be seen to be
needless, and, moreover, better commercial
results will be obtained when it is more
clearly perceived that the recovery of a valuable
ore in the form of a fine slime may be
economically effected by the action of grinders
specially constructed for the purpose of permitting
the hard constituents of the ore to
remain in comparatively large grains, while the
other and softer minerals are reduced to fine
slimes or dust. In other words, a grinding
plant, purposely designed to carry out its work
in exactly the opposite way to that which has
been described as the system aimed at in
ordinary crushing machinery, has its place in
the future of metallurgy. Light mullers are
employed to pound, or to press together, the
crushed grains for a given length of time, and
then sieving machinery completes the operation
by taking out the dust from the more
palpable grains.</p>

<p>In some cases it will be found that an improvement
can be effected by bringing about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the separation of a finer grade of dust than
could be taken out by any kind of sieve which
is commercially practicable on the large scale.
This is more particularly the case in regard
to sulphide ores containing very friable constituents
carrying silver. A fine dry dust-separator
may then be employed constructed on
the principle of a vibrating sloping shelf which
moves rhythmically, either in a horizontal circle
or with a reciprocal motion, and which at the
same time alters its degree of inclination to
the horizontal. When the shelf is nearly level
its vibration drives the coarser particles off;
but the very finest dust does not leave it until
it assumes nearly a vertical position. A large
nest of similar shelves, set close to, and parallel
with, one another, can separate out a great
quantity of well-dried slimes in a very short
space of time.</p>

<h3>DOMESTIC.</h3>


<p>The enormous waste involved in the common
methods of heating is one of the principal
defects of household economy which will be
corrected during the twentieth century. Different
authorities have made varying estimates
of the proportion between the heat which goes
up the chimney of an ordinary grate, and that
which actually passes out into the room fulfilling
its purpose of maintaining an equable
temperature; but it cannot be denied that,
at the very least, something like three-fourths
of the heat generated by the domestic fires of
even the most advanced and civilised nations
goes absolutely to waste&mdash;or rather to worse
than waste&mdash;because the extra smoke produced
in creating it only serves to pollute the atmosphere.
In the cities some degree of progress
has been made in the introduction of heating
appliances which really give warmth to a room
without losing at least seventy-five per cent.
of their heat; but in the country districts,
where open fireplaces are the rule, it is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
unusual to find that more than ninety per
cent. of the heat produced behind the domestic
hearth goes up the chimney.</p>

<p>Sentiment has had a great deal to do with
retarding progress in the direction of improved
house-heating appliances. For countless ages
"the hearth" has been, so to speak, the
domestic altar, around which some of the
most sacred associations of mankind have
gathered, and popular sentiment has declared
that it is not for the iconoclastic inventor or
architect to improve it out of existence, or
even to interfere seriously with either its shape
or the position in the living room from which
it sheds its genial warmth and cheerfulness
around the family circle. A recognition of
this ineradicable popular feeling was involved
in the adoption of the grate, filled with glowing
balls of asbestos composition, by the makers of
gas-heating apparatus. The imitation of the
coal-filled grate is in some cases almost perfect;
and yet it is in this close approximation
to the real article that some lovers of the
domestic fuel-fire find their chief objection,
just as the tricks of anthropoid animals&mdash;so
strongly reminiscent of human beings and yet
distinct&mdash;have the effect of repelling some
people far more than the ways of creatures
utterly unlike man in form and feature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Taking count of the domestic attachment to
a real fuel-filled fireplace or grate as one of the
principal factors in the problem of domestic
heating, it is plain that one way of obviating
the waste of heat which is at present incurred,
without doing violence to that sentiment, is by
making better use of the chimney. The hot-air
pipes and coils which are already so largely
used for indoor heating offer in themselves
a hint in this direction. Long pipes or coils
inserted in the course taken by the heated air
in ascending a chimney become warm, and it
is possible, by taking such a pipe from one
part of the room up the passage and back
again, to cause, by means of a small rotating
fan or other ventilating apparatus, the whole
of the air in the chamber to circulate up
the chimney and back again every few minutes,
gathering warmth as it goes. In this way, and
by exposing as much heating surface to the
warm air in the chimney as possible, the warmth
derived by an ordinary room from a fuel fire
can be more than doubled.</p>

<p>At the same time the risk of spreading
"smuts" over the room can be entirely avoided
first by keeping the whole length of pipe perfectly
air-tight, and attaching it in such a way
as to be readily removed for inspection; and,
secondly, by placing the outward vent in such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a position that the gentle current must mount
upwards, and any dust must fall back again
into a wide funnel-shaped orifice, and by covering
the latter with fine wire gauze. An apparatus
of this kind acts as a remover of dust
from the room instead of adding any to it.
One necessity, however, is the provision of
motive power, very small though it be, to
work the fan or otherwise promote a draught.</p>

<p>Electric heating is, however, the method
which will probably take precedence over
others in all those cases where systems are
tried on their actual merits apart from sentiment
or usage. The wonderful facility afforded
by the electric heating wire for the distribution
of a moderate degree of warmth, in exactly
the proportions in which it may be needed,
gives the electric method an enormous advantage
over its rivals. The fundamental principle
upon which heating by electricity is generally
arranged depends upon the fact that a thin
wire offers more electrical resistance to the
passage of a current than a thick one, and
therefore becomes heated. In the case of the
incandescent lamp, in which the carbon filament
requires to be raised to a white heat and must
be free to emit its light without interference
from opaque matter, it is necessary to protect
the resisting and glowing material by nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
exhausting the air from the hermetically sealed
globe or bulb in which it is enclosed.</p>

<p>But in electrical house-warming, for which
a white heat is not required and in which the
necessary protection from the air can be secured
by embedding the conveying medium in opaque
solid material, the problem becomes much simpler,
because strong metallic wires can be used,
and they may be enclosed in any kind of cement
which does not corrode them and which distributes
the heat while refusing to conduct the
electric current. A network of wire, crossing
and recrossing but always carrying the same
current, may be embedded in plaster and a
gentle heat may be imparted to the whole
mass through the resistance of the wires to
the electricity and their contact with the non-conducting
material.</p>

<p>Concurrently with this method of heating
there is gradually being introduced a practice
of using metallic lathing for the plastering of
dwelling-rooms in place of the old wooden
battens generally employed for lath-and-plaster
work. The solution of the practical problem
which has to be faced seems to depend upon the
prospect of effecting a compromise between the
two systems, introducing thin resisting wire as
the metallic element in such work, but making
all other components from non-conducting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
material. In the event of any "cut-out" or
"short-circuiting" occurring through accidental
injury to the wall, it would be very inconvenient
to be compelled to knock away the
plaster. Moreover, it is not necessary for
ordinary warming purposes that the whole of
the wall, up to the ceiling, should be heated.</p>

<p>Accordingly the system which is likely to
commend itself is that of constructing panels
on some such principle as the one already described,
and affixing them to the wall, forming
a kind of solid dado from three to four feet
from the floor. These can be fastened so as to
facilitate removal for examination and repairs.
When the current is switched on they are
slowly warmed up by the heat generated
through the resistance of the wires, and the
air in the room is gently heated without being
vitiated or deprived of its oxygen as it is by
the presence of flames, whether of fuel or of
gas. Warming footstools will also be provided,
and a room heated in this way will be found
eminently comfortable to live in.</p>

<p>This method of house-warming having once
obtained a decided lead within the cities
and other localities where a cheap electric
current is available, somewhat similar systems,
adapted for the heating of walls by hot air in
tubes, instead of by resistant wires, will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
largely adopted in the rural districts, more
particularly in churches and other places of
public assemblage. The progress made in
this direction during the last few years of the
nineteenth century is already noteworthy, but
when electric-heating really gets a good chance
to force the pace of improvement, the day will
soon arrive when it will be regarded as nothing
less than barbarous to ask people to sit during
the winter months in places not evenly warmed
all through by methods which result in the
distribution of the heat exactly as it is wanted.</p>

<p>Ventilation is another household reform
which will be very greatly accelerated by the
presence of electric power of low cost. The
great majority of civilised people, as yet, have
no idea of ventilation excepting that highly
unreasonable kind which depends upon leaving
their houses and other buildings partly
open to the outside weather. One man is
sitting in church under a down draught from
an open window above him, while others, in
different parts of the same building, may be
weltering in the heat and feeling stifled through
the vitiated air. In dwelling-houses the great
majority of living rooms really have no other
effective form of ventilation than the draught
from the fireplace. The strength of this
draught, again, is regulated to a very large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
extent by the speed and direction of the outside
wind.</p>

<p>In calm and sultry weather, when ventilation
is most needed, the current of air from the
fireplace may be very slight indeed; while in
the wild and boisterous days succeeding a
sudden change of weather, the living rooms
are subjected to such a drop in temperature
and are swept by such draughts of cold air
that the inmates are very liable to catch colds
and influenza. Hence has arisen in the British
Islands, and in the colder countries of Europe
and America, the very general desire among
the poorer classes to suppress all ventilation.
Rooms are closed at the commencement of
winter and practically remain so until the
summer season. Many people whose circumstances
have improved, and who pass suddenly
from ill-ventilated houses to those which have
better access to the outside air, find the change
so severe upon their constitutions and habits
that they give a bad name to everything in the
shape of ventilation. Meanwhile the dread of
draughts causes people to exclude the fresh
air to such an extent that consumption and
many other diseases are fostered and engendered.</p>

<p>All this arises mainly from the very serious
mistake of imagining that it is possible to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
move air without the exercise of force. In
the case of the draught caused by a fire no
doubt an active force is employed in the energy
of the heated air ascending the chimney, and
in the corresponding inrush. This latter is
usually drawn from below the door&mdash;the very
worst place from which it can be taken,
seeing that in the experience of most people it
is by getting the feet chilled, through draughts
along the floor, that the worst colds are generally
contracted. Fireplaces are not unusually
regarded as a direct means for ventilation, and
with regard to nearly all the devices commonly
adopted in houses and public buildings, it may
be said that they lack the first requisite for a
scientific system of renewing the air, namely
a source of power by means of which to shift
it from outside to inside, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. There
is no direction in which a more pressing need
exists for the distribution of power in small
quantities than in regard to the ventilation of
private and public edifices.</p>

<p>The circular fan, placed in the centre piece
of the ceiling and controlled by an electric
switch on the wall, is the principal type of
apparatus applicable to the purposes of ventilation.
As electric lighting of dwelling-houses
becomes more common, and ultimately almost
universal within cities, the practice will be to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
arrange for lighting and for ventilation at the
same time. But, unfortunately, the current
now principally employed for electric lighting
and consisting of a series of impulses, first in
one direction and then in the opposite, "alternating"
with wonderful rapidity, is not well
adapted for driving small motors of the types
now in use. One improvement in domestic
economy greatly needed in the twentieth century
consists in the invention of a really
effective simple and economical "alternate-current"
motor. This is a matter which will be
referred to in dealing with electrical machines.
That the problem will be solved before many
years have passed there is no good reason to
doubt.</p>

<p>In the meantime many laudable endeavours
are being made towards the application of the
pressure from water pipes to the purpose of
driving ventilating fans. The extreme wastefulness
of power and of water involved in this
method of dealing with the difficulty may be
partially overlooked on account of the very
small amounts required to produce an effect
in the desired direction; and yet there is no
doubt that a recognition of the wastefulness
acts to some extent as a deterrent to artificial
ventilation. The benefits of the system are
not sufficiently obvious or showy to induce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
any class of people, excepting physicians and
persons fully acquainted with the principles of
hygiene, to sanction a material outlay upon the
object. When an exactly suitable alternate-current
motor has been invented the standard
electric light installation will be practically
one apparatus with the ventilating fan, and
the cost of the latter will hardly be felt as a
separate item.</p>

<p>In cooking there is in existing ordinary
methods the same enormous waste of heat as
there is in the warming of rooms. Something,
no doubt, has been done in the direction of
economy by the invention of new and improved
forms of stoves, but a great preponderance of
the heat generated in the fire of even the best
stove goes up the chimney. The electric oven,
as already invented, is perhaps the nearest
approach to a really economical "cooker" that
has yet been proposed; but even before the
general adoption of such an apparatus there will
be ample room for improvement in the cooking
stove, first as regards insulation, and secondly
in the distribution of the fuel around the objects
to be heated. One principal cause of the
waste that goes on arises from the fact that
the fire burns away from the place at which
its heat is most beneficially applied, and no
means are adopted, as in the case of the candle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
in a carriage lamp, for keeping it up to the
required level. Additions of fuel are made
from the top with the immediate effect of
checking the heat.</p>

<p>A great advance in economy of fuel will
take place when the household coal intended
for cooking purposes is ground up together with
the proper proportions of certain waste products
of chemistry, so as to make a "smouldering
mixture" which can be kept regularly
supplied to a shallow or thin fire box by
pressure applied from beneath or at the parts
farthest away from the objects to be heated.
An oven, for instance, may be surrounded by
a "jacket" filled with ground smouldering
mixture having a non-conducting insulator
outside and a connection with a chimney.
The heat from the fuel is thus kept in close
proximity to the objects requiring to be cooked,
and comparatively small waste results.</p>

<p>It is by taking advantage of their superior
facilities in the same direction that gas and
inflammable oils have already made their
mark in the sphere of domestic cookery.
Regarded as fuel their initial cost may be
relatively heavy; and yet, owing to their more
exact method of application, they often effect
a saving in the end. Not only do they bring
the fire closer to the articles to be heated or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
cooked, but they also make it easy for the fire
to be turned off or on, and this in itself is
an important source of economy. Still, with
the advent of cheaper and more accessible
power in every centre of population, the cost
of grinding coal and of mixing it in order to
form a fuel comparable in respect of convenience
and economy with gas and oil will be so
greatly reduced that the "black diamond"
will still continue to challenge its rivals in the
arena of competition presented by the demands
of domestic economy.</p>

<p>Light, as well as heat and air, requires to
be evenly and equably distributed throughout
the dwelling-house before anything approaching
an ideal residence can be secured. As
the science of hygiene advances it is demonstrated
more and more clearly that sunlight&mdash;and
even diffused daylight&mdash;may be used as a
most effective weapon against the spread of
disease. Alternations of deep gloom in the
dwelling-house with the superior light resulting
from brighter weather produce many kinds of
nervous derangement, not the least deleterious
of which arise from the unnecessary strain to
which the eyesight is subjected. The promise
of the future is that, through the abundance
of windows provided in the walls, roofs and
porches of our dwelling-houses&mdash;but all supplemented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
with shutters and blinds of various
kinds&mdash;there shall be a possibility of regulating,
far more accurately than at present, the accessibility
of light from outside according to the
brightness or dulness of the day.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be expected that many people
will build "Crystal Palaces" in which to reside;
but with the immense progress that is being
made in the construction of dwellings with
iron or steel frames, and in the adaptation of
various materials so that they may serve for
building purposes in conjunction with metallic
frameworks, it seems clear that many roofs,
as well as large portions of walls, will in future
be made on the composite principle, using steel
and glass. These will, to a large extent, be
permanently sheltered from the direct rays of
the sun when high in the heavens, by shutters
constructed on the louvre principle so that they
may admit the light from the sky continually,
but actual rays or beams of sunlight only for
a short time after sunrise and at the close of
day. The ceilings, if any are provided under
the roofs, will also be glazed.</p>

<p>The obstacles presented in the way of such
a reform in a city like London may at first
sight seem so serious as to be practically insuperable.
Long rows of three or four storied
houses certainly offer but few facilities for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
admission of light through the roofs of any
but the rooms on the top floors, and yet it is
in the dwelling-houses of this type that the
depression caused by gloom and the absence
of light during the hours of day are most
severely felt as a source of nervous depression.
Evolution in a matter of this sort will take
place gradually and along the line of least
resistance. Portions of courts, areas and yards
will be glazed over in the way described; and
it will be found that those rooms which are
thus enclosed and sheltered from the wind and
rain, but left open to the daylight, constitute
the most cheerful sitting places in the houses.
Then, as rebuilding and alterations proceed,
many houses will gradually be remodelled&mdash;at
least as regards some of their rooms&mdash;in
the same direction. Physicians will become
increasingly insistent on the necessity for admitting
plenty of light into the abodes of the
sick, more particularly of families inclined
towards consumption.</p>

<p>A very large trade will spring up during
the twentieth century in household cooling
apparatus for use in hot climates. The
colonial expansion towards which all European
races are now tending inevitably means that
very many thousands of persons whose ancestors
have been accustomed to life in cold or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
temperate climates, will be induced to dwell
in the dry and warm, or in the humid tropical
regions of the earth. It will be an important
task of the British, Continental and American
machinists of the twentieth century to turn
out convenient pieces of apparatus which shall
be available for ventilating houses, especially
during the night, and for reducing the temperature
in them to something approaching
that which is natural to the inmates. The
old clumsy punkah will be replaced by circular
fans keeping up a gentle current of air with
a minimum of noise or annoyance of any kind.</p>

<p>At present it is only in specially favoured
circumstances that these quiet-working circular
punkahs can be actuated by mechanical force,
that is to say where a prime motor, or an
electric current, or a reticulated water supply
for driving a suitable machine may be at hand.
In other situations the use of compressed air
or gas may be resorted to, and for this purpose
small capsules, similar to those already introduced
for making soda water by the liberation
of compressed carbonic acid gas, will be found
handy. For a very small sum of money the
householder will be able to purchase a sufficient
number of capsules to ensure motive power for
his fan during a week of hot nights.</p>

<p>A convenient form of small motor suitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
for being driven by compressed air or gases in
this way is one in which a diminutive turbine
or other wheel is set at the bottom of a thin
tube of mercury. The capsule, being fastened
to the lower end of this apparatus, liberates
at very short intervals of time bubbles of air
or gas, which, in the upward ascent, drive
the wheel. The arrangement depends upon
the fact that a stream of gas ascending in a
heavy liquid behaves in the same way as a
stream of water descending by its own weight
and turning a water-wheel. It supplies what
is perhaps the simplest and most inexpensive
small motor available for the lightest domestic
work to which a gentle but continuous source
of power is applicable.</p>

<p>For actually cooling the air, as well as keeping
it in motion, similar devices will be resorted
to, with the addition of the circulation of the
current of air through coils of pipes laid under
the surface of the ground. In this way householders
will have all the advantages of living
in cool underground rooms without incurring
the discomforts and dangers which are often
inseparable from that mode of life. In the
coastal regions, which usually have the most
trying climates for Europeans living in tropical
countries, a method of cooling the houses will
be based on the fact that at moderate depths
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in the sea the prevailing temperature is a
steady one, not much above the freezing point of
water. Almost every seaport town within the
tropics&mdash;where white residents in their houses
swelter nightly in the greatest discomfort
from the heat&mdash;is in close proximity to deep
ocean water, in which, at all seasons of the year,
the regular temperature is only about thirty-four
degrees Fahr. The cost of steel piping
strong enough to withstand the pressure of
the water in places which possess absolutely
the coolest temperature of the ocean would be
very heavy; but, on the other hand, the actual
reduction of heat demanded for the satisfactory
cooling of the air in a dwelling-room is not by
any means great, and at quite shallow depths
the heat of the air can be satisfactorily abstracted
by the sea water surrounding coils of
pipes.</p>

<p>Even in colder climates it seems likely that
similar systems will be found useful in producing
a preliminary reduction in the temperature
of the air employed in keeping fresh
foodstuffs such as meat, fruits and vegetables.
Fruits especially, when placed in suitable
receptacles, and stored at temperatures quite
steady at about the freezing point of water,
will not only be readily kept on land from
one season to another, but will be transported
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to markets thousands of miles distant from the
growers, and sold in practically the same condition
as if they had just been picked from
the trees. During the twentieth century the
proportion of the fruit eaters among the peoples
of the great manufacturing countries will be
very largely augmented, and this result will
be brought about mainly through the instrumentality
of methods of keeping perishable
produce free from deterioration by maintaining
it almost at the freezing point&mdash;a temperature
at which, under suitable conditions as regards
exclusion of moisture, and steadiness of hygrometric
pressure, the germs of decay in food
are practically prevented from coming to
maturity.</p>

<p>For the cooling of dwelling-rooms in places
distant from the sea, various systems, depending
upon the supply of dry cold air from
central stations through pipes to the dwellings
of subscribers, will no doubt be brought into
operation. This, however, will only be practicable
in the more populous localities having
plenty of residents ready to contribute to the
expense. For more isolated houses the cooling
and ventilating apparatus of the future may
be a modification of the "shower-blast" which
has been successfully adapted to metallurgical
purposes. When downward jets of water, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
in a shower-bath, are enclosed in a large pipe
connected horizontally with a room but having
facilities for the escape of the water underneath,
a strong draught of cool air is created, and
the prevailing temperature is quickly reduced.
An apparatus of this kind may be intended
for application either to the ventilators or to
the windows of rooms.</p>

<p>Lifts for conveying persons from one storey
of a building to another will probably undergo
a considerable amount of modification during
the next few years. The establishment of
central electric stations and the distribution
of electricity for lighting and for power will
offer a very great premium upon the preference
for electric motors for lifts. As soon as a
maximum of efficiency, combined with the
minimum of cost, has been attained, there will
be a demand for the introduction of lifts in
positions where the traffic is not large enough
to warrant the constant presence of an attendant.
In fact the desire will be for some kind
of elevator which shall be just as free to the
use of each individual as is the staircase of an
ordinary house.</p>

<p>For this purpose, inclined planes having
moving canvas or similar ramps will be extensively
brought into use. The passenger steps
upon what is practically an endless belt having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
suitable slats upon it to prevent his foot from
slipping, and, as the hand-railing at the side
of this moves concurrently, he is taken up,
without any effort, to the landing on which
he may alight quite steadily. When this idea,
which has already been brought into operation,
has been more fully developed, it will be seen
that a large circular slowly-revolving disc, set
at an angle and properly furnished, will supply
a more convenient form of free elevator. One
side will be used by those who are going up
and the other by those who wish to come down.
The "well" of the staircase for such a lift is
made in elliptical form, like the shadow projection
of a circle. Steps can be provided so that,
when not in motion, the lift will be a staircase
not differing much from the old style.</p>

<h3>ELECTRIC MESSAGES, ETC.</h3>


<p>The telegraphic wire in the home and street
will fulfil a very important part in the economy
of the twentieth century. For conveying intelligence,
as well as for heating, cooking and
lighting, the electric current will become one
of the most familiar of all the forces called in to
assist in domestic arrangements. The rapidity
with which the electric bell-push has taken
the place of the old-fashioned knocker and
the bell-hanger's system affords one indication
of the readiness with which those forms of
electric apparatus which are adapted to all
the purposes of communicating and reminding
will recommend themselves to the public
during the twentieth century.</p>

<p>In another direction the eagerness with
which every advance in the telephone is
hailed by the people may well offer an
augury of rapid progress in the immediate
future. In this department invention will
aim just as much at simplification as at elaboration;
and some of the pieces of domestic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
electrical apparatus universally used during
the twentieth century will be astonishingly
cheap.</p>

<p>The call to awake in the morning will, in
cities and towns, be made by wireless telegraphy,
which will also be used for the purpose
of regulating the domestic clocks, so that
if desired any suitable form of clock alarm
may be used with the most perfect confidence.
A tentative system of this kind has been
adopted in connection with certain telephone
exchanges, in which special officers are told
off whose duty it is to call those subscribers
who have paid the small fee covering the
expense. These officers are required to time
their intimations according to the previously
expressed wishes of subscribers. This kind
of service, as well as the regulation of the
household clock, is eminently a department
of domestic economy in which wireless telegraphy
will prove itself useful, because it
does not demand that a subscriber shall have
gone to the expense of installing a wire to his
house and of paying a rent or fee for the use
of one.</p>

<p>The clock controlled by wireless telegraphy
will doubtless undergo a rapid development
from the time when it is first introduced.
Practically the same principles which enable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the electrician to utilise the "Hertzian waves,"
or ether vibrations, for the purpose of setting
a clock right once a day, or once an hour,
will permit of an impulse, true to time, being
sent from the central station every second,
or every minute, and when this has been accomplished
it will be seen that there is no
more use for the maintenance of elaborate
clockworks at any place excepting the central
station. The domestic clock will, in fact,
become mainly a "receiver" for the wireless
telegraphic apparatus, and its internal mechanism
will be reduced, perhaps, to a couple of
wheels, which are necessary to transmit the
motion of a minute-hand to that which indicates
the hours.</p>

<p>The fire-alarm of the future must be very
simple and inexpensive in order to ensure its
introduction, not only into offices and warehouses
but also into shops and houses. The
fire-insurance companies will very shortly
awake to the fact that prompt telegraphic
alarm in case of fire is worth far more than
the majority of the prohibitions upon which
they are accustomed to insist by way of
rendering fires less likely. The main principles
upon which the electric fire-alarm will
be operated have already been worked out
and partially adopted.  In the system of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
fuses and cut-outs used in connection with
electric lighting, the methods of preventing
fire due to the development of excessive heat
have been well studied. But simplification is
particularly required in the case of those fire-alarms
which are to be useful for giving intimation
of a conflagration from any cause
arising.</p>

<p>As the telegraphic and telephonic wires
are extended so as to traverse practically all
the streets of every city, the fire-insurance
companies will find it to their advantage to
promote a simple plan, depending on the use
of a combustible thread passing round little
pulleys in the corners of all the rooms and
finally out to the front, where an electrical
"contact-maker" is fixed, so that on the
thread being burnt and broken at any point
in its circuit, an electric message will be at
once sent along the nearest wire to the fire-brigade
station and a bell set ringing both
inside and outside the premises.</p>

<p>Somewhat similar systems will be used for
checking the enterprises of the burglar. The
best protected safes of the future will be enmeshed
in networks of wires encased in some
material which will render it impossible to
determine their positions from the outside.
These wires will be so related to an electric
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
circuit that the breaking of any one of them,
at any part of its course, will have the effect
of ringing a bell and giving warning at the
police station, as well as at other places where
potential thief-catchers may be on hand. For
doors and windows very simple contact devices
have already been brought out, but the principal
objection to their general adoption arises from
the fact that so very many houses remain unconnected
with any telephone system which may
be made available for calling the police. Even
were all houses connected it is true that
in some instances attempts might be made to
cut the wires when a raid was in contemplation,
but the risk of discovery in any such operation
would prove a very powerful deterrent. In
fact the telephone wire, more than any other
mechanical device, is destined to aid in "improving"
the burglar out of existence.</p>

<p>With the indefinite multiplication of telephone
subscribers at very cheap rates, there
will come a powerful inducement towards the
invention of new appliances for rendering the
subscriber independent of the attention of
officers at any central exchange. The duty of
connecting an individual subscriber with any
other with whom he may desire to converse is,
after all, a purely mechanical one, and eminently
of a kind which, by a combination of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
engineering and electrical skill, may be quite
successfully accomplished. In the apparatus
which will probably be in use during the
twentieth century, each subscriber will have
a dial carrying on its face the names and
numbers of all those with whom he is in the
habit of holding communication. This will
be his "smaller dial," and beside it will be
another, intended for only occasional use,
through which, by exercising a little more
patience, he may connect himself with any
other subscriber whatever. Corresponding
dials will be fixed in the central office.</p>

<p>Under this system, when the subscriber
desires to secure a connection, he moves a
handle round his dial until the pointer in its
circuit comes to the desired number. An
electrical impulse is thus sent along the wire
to the central station for every number over
which the pointer passes, and the corresponding
pointer or contact-maker at the central
station is moved exactly in sympathy. When
the correct number is reached the subscriber
is in connection with the person with whom
he desires to converse. If, however, the latter
should be already engaged, a return impulse
causes the bell of the first subscriber to ring.
Of course the prime cost of installing such a
system as this will be greater than in the case
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of the simple hand-connected telephones; but
the two systems can be used conjointly, and
the immense convenience, especially to large
firms, of being able to go straight to the parties
with whom they wish to communicate, will
induce many of them to adopt the automatic
apparatus as soon as it has been perfected.</p>

<p>Wireless telephony must come to the front
in the near future, but at first for only very
special purposes. The prospect of the profits
that would be attendant on working up a
business unhampered by the heavy capital
charges which weigh upon the owners of
telephone wires must stimulate inventive enterprise
to a remarkable degree in this particular
line. The main difficulty, however, in the
application of the system to general purposes
will lie in the need for an ingenious but simple
means for enabling one subscriber to call
another.</p>

<p>For this purpose probably the synchronised
clock system already referred to will be
found essential, each office or house being
furnished with a timekeeper of this type kept
in constant agreement with a central clock,
and so arranged that only when the ethereal
electrical impulse is given at a certain fixed
point in the minute, will any particular subscriber's
bell be rung. This may be effected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
by some such arrangement as a revolving
drum, perforated at a different part of its
periphery for each individual subscriber, and
capable of permitting the electrical contact
which makes a magnet and rings the bell only
at the fraction of a moment when the subscriber's
slot passes the pointer.</p>

<p>This will mean, of course, that only at a
certain almost infinitesimally small space of
time in the duration of each minute will it be
possible to call any particular subscriber, or
rather to release the mechanism which will
set his bell ringing for perhaps a minute at a
time. In the presence of unscrupulous competition,
resulting in the flinging out of
Hertzian wave vibrations promiscuously, for
the purpose of destroying a rival's chances of
obtaining satisfactory connections, it would be
necessary to make rather more complicated
arrangements of a nature analogous to those
of the puzzle lock. Instead of one impulse
during the minute, two or three would be
required, in order to release the mechanism
for ringing any subscriber's bell; and no ring
would take place unless the time-spaces between
these impulses were exactly in accordance
with the agreed form, which might be
varied at convenient intervals.</p>

<p>Yet in the cases in which wireless telephony
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and telegraphy are taken up by local public
authorities having power to forbid any one
playing "dog in the manger," by preventing
useful work by others while failing to promote
it himself, the simpler system of wireless
telephone call will be practicable. With the
advance of municipalisation, and of intelligent
collectivism generally, enterprises of public
utility will be guarded from mere cut-throat
commercial hostility much more sedulously
in the twentieth century than they have been
in the past.</p>

<p>A great multitude of new applications of
the telegraphic and telephonic systems will be
introduced in the immediate future. Not only
will those subscribers who are connected by
wire with central stations have the advantage
of being called at any hour in the morning
according to their intimated wishes, but such
services as lighting the fires in winter mornings,
so that rooms may be fairly warmed before
they are entered, will be performed by electric
messages sent from a central station.</p>

<p>Drawings will also be despatched by telegraph.
For such purposes as the transmission
of sketches from the scene of any stirring
event, the first really practical application of
drawing by telegraph will probably depend
upon the use of a large number of code words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
divided into two groups, each of which, on
the principles of co-ordinate geometry, will
indicate a different degree of distance from
the base line and from the side line respectively,
so that from any sketch a correct
message in code may be made up and the
drawing may be reconstructed at the receiving
end. Illustrated newspapers will in this way
obtain drawings exactly at the same time as
their other messages, and distant occurrences
will be brought before the public eye much
more vividly and more correctly than has ever
hitherto been practicable.</p>

<p>For special objects, also, photographs can be
sent by telegraph through the use of the photo-relief
in plaster of Paris, or other suitable
material, which travels backwards and forwards
underneath a pointer, the rising and falling of
which is accurately represented by thick and
thin lines&mdash;or by the darker and lighter photographic
printing of a beam of light of varying
intensity&mdash;at the other end, so that a shaded
reproduction of the photograph is produced.
Relief at the sending end is in this way translated
into darkness of shade at the receiving
end. Any general expansion of this system,
if it comes, will necessarily be postponed till
long after the full possibilities of the codeword
plan have been exploited, because the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
latter works in exactly with the ordinary
methods for sending telegraphic matter.</p>

<p>The keen competition between submarine
and wireless telegraphy will be one of the
most exciting contests furnished by electrical
progress in the first quarter of the new century.
Attention will be devoted to those directions
on the surface of the globe in which it is
possible to send messages almost entirely by
land lines, and to bridge over comparatively
small intervals of space from land to land by
wireless telegraphy. Thus the Asiatic and
Canadian route may be expected shortly to
enter into competition with the Atlantic cables
in telegraphic business to the United States;
while Australia will be reached <i>vi&acirc;</i> Singapore
and Java.</p>

<p>A great impetus will be given to the wireless
system as a commercial undertaking when
arrangements have been perfected for causing
the receiver at any particular station to translate
its message into a form suitable for sending
automatically. When this has been done,
many of the wayside stations will be almost
entirely self-working, and messages, indeed,
may be despatched from island to island, or
from one floating station to another across the
Atlantic itself.</p>

<p>Another requirement for really cheap telegraphy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
on the new system is a more rapid
method of making the letters or signals. The
irregular intervals at which the sparks from
the coil of the transmitter fly from one terminal
to the other render it impossible to split
up the succession of flashes into intervals on
the dot-and-dash principle, without providing
for each dot a much longer period of time than
is required for the transmission of messages
on land lines. In fact the need for going
slowly in the sending of the message is the
principal stumbling-block which disconcerts
ordinary telegraphic operators when they come
to try wireless telegraphy. For remedying
this defect the most hopeful outlook is in the
direction of a multiplication of the pieces of
apparatus for spark-making and the combining
of pairs of them in such a way that, whenever
the first one fails during an appreciable interval
of time to emit a spark, the second is called
into requisition. In this way a constant stream
of sparks may be ensured, without incurring
the risk of running faster than the coil will
supply the electrical impulses necessary for
the transmission of the message.</p>

<p>Increased rapidity in land telegraphy by the
ordinary system of transmission by wire, and
facility in making the records at the receiving
end in easily read typewriting&mdash;these are two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
desiderata which at the close of the nineteenth
century have been almost attained, but which
will take some time to introduce to general
notice. In the commercial system of the
twentieth century the merchant's clerk will
write his messages on a typewriter which perforates
a strip of paper with holes corresponding
to the various letters, while it sets down
in printing, on another strip, the letters themselves.
The latter will be kept as a record,
but the former will be taken to the telegraph
office and put through the sending machine
without being read by the operator. The
message will print itself at the other end and
wrap itself up in secret, nothing but the address
being made visible to the operator.</p>

<p>For the use of the general public who are
not possessed of the special apparatus necessary
to perforate the paper another system is available.
Sets of movable type may be provided
at the telegraph office in small compartments,
the letters being on one side and indentations
corresponding to the required perforations
being cut or stamped into the other sides of
the movable pieces. The sender of a message
will set it up in a long shallow tray or "galley"
like those used by printers, and he will then
turn the faces of the letters downwards and see
the whole passed through the machine without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
being read by the operator; after which he
can distribute the letters if he chooses. In this
way telegraphy will gradually become at once
far more secret and far cheaper than it is at
present, and a large amount of correspondence
which at present passes through the post will
be sent along the wire.</p>

<p>Many merchants will have their telephonic
apparatus fitted with arrangements for setting
up type or perforating strips of paper, as
already described; and also with receiving
apparatus for making the records in typewriting.
If they fail to find a subscriber or
correspondent on hand at the time when he
is wanted, they can write a note to him which
he will find hanging on a paper strip from his
telephone when he returns. Another mode of
accomplishing a somewhat similar result is to
provide the telephone receiver itself with a
moving strip of steel, which, in its varying
degrees of magnetisation, records the spoken
words so that they will, at some distance of
time, actuate the diaphragm of the receiver
and emit spoken words. The degree of permanency
which can be attained by this system
is, of course, a vital point as regards its practical
merits.</p>

<p>Still unsolved electrical problems are the
making of a satisfactory alternate current
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
motor suitable for running with the kind of
currents generally used for electric lighting
purposes&mdash;the utilisation of the glow lamp
having a partial vacuum or attenuated gas for
giving a cheap and soft light somewhat on the
principle of the Geissler tube&mdash;and last, but
not least, the direct conversion of heat into
electricity.</p>

<p>With regard to the first-mentioned, the
prospects have been materially altered by a
discovery announced at the New York meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science within a few weeks of
the close of the nineteenth century. The handy
and effective alternate current motor indeed
seemed then as far distant as it had been in
1896, when Sir David Salomons remarked, in
his work on <i>Electric Light Installations</i> (vol.
ii., p. 97): "No satisfactory alternate current
motor available on all circuits exists as yet,
although," he added later, "the demand for
such an appliance increases daily". It seems,
however, that electricians have been looking
in the wrong direction for the solution of using
the same wire for alternate current lighting
and for motive power at the same time. Professor
Bedell, of Cornell University, announced
at the New York meeting referred to his discovery
of the important fact that when direct
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and alternate currents are sent over the same
line each behaves as if the other were not there,
and thus the same line can be used for two
distinct systems of transmitting electrical
energy. No time will be lost in putting this
announcement to the test, not only of scientific
but also of practical verification, and the probability
is that all electric lighting stations in the
twentieth century will contain not only dynamos
of one type for the supply of light, but also
direct current generators for transmitting
power in all directions over the same cables.</p>

<p>The glow lamp having no carbon filament,
but setting up a bright light with only a fraction
of the resistance presented by carbon, would,
if perfected, render electric lighting by far the
cheapest as well as the best method of illumination.
Tentative work has indicated a high
degree of probability that success will be
achieved, and the glowing bulb is at any rate
a possibility of the future which it will be well
to reckon with.</p>

<p>In reference to the conversion of heat into
electricity without the intervention of machinery
to provide motion, and thus to cause magnetic
fields to cross one another, very little
promise has yet been shown of any fundamental
principle upon which a practical apparatus of
the kind could be based. The electrician who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
works at this problem has to begin almost
<i>de novo</i>, and his task is an immensely difficult
one, although on every ground of analogy
success certainly looks possible. In the meantime,
as has already been indicated, the steam
turbine and dynamo combined, working practically
as a single machine for the generation
of electricity, offers practically the nearest
approach to direct conversion which is yet
well in sight.</p>

<h3>WARFARE.</h3>


<p>The last notable war of the nineteenth century
has falsified the anticipations of nearly all the
makers of small arms. The magazine rifle
was held to be so perfect in its trajectory, and
in the rapidity with which it could discharge
its convenient store of cartridges in succession,
that the bayonet charge had been put outside
of the region of possibility in warfare. Those
who reasoned thus were forgetting, to a large
extent, that while small arms have been improving
so also has artillery, and that a bayonet
charge covered by a demoralising fire of field-pieces,
mortars, and quick-firing artillery is a
very different thing from one in which the
assailants alone are the targets exposed to
fire. Given that two opposing armies are
possessed of weapons of about equal capacity
for striking from a distance, they may do one
another a great deal of harm without coming
to close quarters at all. Yet victory will rest
with the men who have sufficient bravery, skill
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and ingenuity to cross the fire-zone and tackle
their enemies hand to hand.</p>

<p>Smoke-producing shells and other forms of
projected cover, designed to mask the advance
of cavalry and infantry, will greatly assist in
the work of rendering this task of crossing the
fire-zone less dangerous, notwithstanding any
possible improvement that may be effected in
the magazine-rifle. Already it has been observed
that much of the surprise and confusion
which terrifies those who have no bayonets,
when subjected to a cannonade and at the
same time brought face to face with a bayonet
charge, arises from the fact that they cannot
see to shoot straight, owing to the haze produced
by the smoke and its blinding effects
upon the eyes.</p>

<p>Special smoke-producing shells, made for
the express purpose of covering a charge, will
soon be evolved from the laboratory of the
chemist in pursuance of this clue. In addition
to shells and other missiles, small pieces of
steel-piping will be projected by mortars into
the fire-swept zone, in order to supplement the
defects of natural cover which, of course, are
nearly always as great as possible, seeing that
the ground has generally been selected by the
side against which the attack is being directed.</p>

<p>The task of enabling a rifleman to shoot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
straight has been taken up with extraordinary
zeal and ability compared with the amount of
skill and effort devoted to the corresponding
or opposing object of spoiling his aim and
preventing him from getting a shot in. When
this latter has been to some extent accomplished,
mainly by the agency of artillery, the
bayonet and other weapons for use at close
quarters will once more be in the ascendant.
Thin shields of hard steel will be affixed to the
rifles of the attacking party, so as to deflect the
bullets wherever possible.</p>

<p>This baffling of the rifleman by the artillery
supporting the cavalry and bayonet charge will
produce momentous changes, not only in the
future of war, but also in that of international
relations. Anything which tends to discount
the value of personal bravery and to elevate
the tactics of the ambuscade and the sharp-shooting
expedition gives, <i>pro tanto</i>, an advantage
to the meaner-spirited races of mankind,
and places them more or less in a position of
mastery over those who hold higher racial
traditions. The man who will face the risk
of being shot in the open generally belongs to
a higher type of humanity than he who only
shoots from behind cover.</p>

<p>Moreover, the nations which have the skill
and ingenuity to manufacture new weapons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
self-defence belong to a higher class than those which
only acquire advanced warlike munitions by purchase. One
of the early international movements of the twentieth century will be
directed towards the prohibition of the sale of such weapons as
magazine-rifles, quick-firing field guns, and torpedoes to any savage
or barbarous race. It will be accounted as treason to civilisation for
any member of the international family to permit its manufacturers to
sell the latest patterns of weapons to races whose ascendency might
possibly become a menace to civilisation. As factors in determining
the survival of the fittest, the elements of high character, bravery,
and intellectual development must be conserved in their maximum
efficiency at all hazards.</p>

<p>Another potent element in the safeguards
of civilisation may be seen in the increased
effectiveness of weapons for coastal defence.
The hideous nightmare of a barbarian irruption,
such as those which almost erased culture
and intellect from the face of Europe during
the dark ages of the fourth, fifth and sixth
centuries, may occasionally be seen exercising
its influence in the pessimistic writings which
are from time to time issued from the Press
predicting the coming ascendency of the yellow man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
However the case may be in regard to
nations which are accessible by land to the
encroachments of the Asiatic, there is no doubt
that those countries which are divided off by
the sea have been rendered much more secure
through the rapid advances which have been
made in the modern appliances for defending
coasts and harbours. In naval tactics, also, it
will be more and more clearly seen that to
possess and defend the harbours where coaling
can be carried out is practically to possess and
defend the trade of the high seas; and the
essence of good maritime policy will be to so
locate the defended harbours that they may
afford the greatest amount of protection, having
in view the harm that may be done by an
enemy's harbours in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The most effective naval weapon in the
future will undoubtedly be the torpedo, but,
like the bayonet, it requires to be in the hands
of brave men before its value as the ultimate
arbiter of naval conflict can be demonstrated.
Much fallacious teaching has arisen from what
has been called the lessons of certain naval
wars which occurred on the coasts of South
America and China&mdash;international embroilments
in which mercenaries, or only half-trained
seamen and engineers, were engaged.
On similar fallacious grounds it was argued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
that the magazine-rifle had put the bayonet
out of the court of military arbitrament, and
the South African war has proved conclusively
how erroneous was that idea. The use of the
torpedo-boat and of the weapons which it
carries must always demand, like that of the
bayonet, men of the strongest nerve, and of
the greatest devotion to their duty and to their
country.</p>

<p>Fifty miles an hour is a rate which is already
in sight as the speed of the future torpedo-boat,
the first turbine steamer of the British Navy
having achieved forty-three miles an hour
before the end of the nineteenth century. It
should be distinctly understood, however, that
such a speed cannot be kept up for any great
length of time and that long voyages are out of
the question. The r&ocirc;le of the turbine torpedo-boat
will be to "get home" with its weapon
in the shortest practicable time. Hence its
great value for the defence of harbours by
striking at distances of perhaps two or three
hours' steaming.</p>

<p>On the high seas the battle-ships, which
will virtually be the cruisers of the future,
will be provided with turbine torpedo-boats,
carried slung in convenient positions and ready
at short notice to be let slip like greyhounds.
During the hazardous run of the torpedo-boat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
towards the enemy, various devices will be employed
for the purpose of baffling his aim, such
for instance as the emission of volumes of
smoke from the bows and the erection of
broad network blinds covering the sight of
the little craft, but capable of being shifted
from side to side, so that the enemy's marksmen
may never know exactly what part of the
object in sight is to be aimed at. The torpedo
will be carried on a mast, which at the right
moment can be lowered to form a projecting
spar like a bowsprit; and the explosion that
will take place on its impact with the enemy's
hull will be enough to blow a fatal breach in
any warship afloat.</p>

<p>For harbour defence and the safety of the
battle-ship the wire-guided and propelled torpedo
will form a second line behind the fast
torpedo-boat. This type of weapon strikes
with more unerring accuracy than any other
yet included in the armoury of naval warfare,
because it is under the control of the marksman
from the time of its launching until it
fulfils its deadly mission. Its range, of course,
is strictly limited; but it may be worked to
advantage within the distances at which the
best naval artillery can be depended upon to
make good practice.</p>

<p>The least costly and the lightest form is that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
in which the backward pulling of two wires,
unwinding two drums on the torpedo, actuates
two screws at greater or less speeds according
to the rapidity of the motion imparted, any
advantage of speed in one screw over the other
being responded to by an alteration in the
direction taken by the weapon. The torpedo
may be set so as to dive from the surface at
any desired interval; but, of course, an appearance
in the form of at least a flash is
necessary to enable the operator to judge in
what direction he is sending his missile. Small
torpedo-boats, not manned but sticking to the
surface, may be used in the same manner. Each
one no doubt runs a very great risk of being hit
by shot or shell aimed at them; but out of half a
dozen, discharged at short intervals, it would be
practically impossible for an enemy to make
certain that one at least did not find its billet.</p>

<p>The submarine boat will have some useful
applications in peace; but its range of utility
in warfare is likely to be very limited. It is
hopeless to expect the eyes of sailors to see
any great distance under the water; therefore
the descent must be made within sight of the
enemy, who has only to surround himself with
placed contact-torpedoes hanging to a depth,
and to pollute the water in order to render
the assault an absolutely desperate enterprise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Military aeronautics, like submarine operations
in naval warfare, have been somewhat
overrated. Visions of air-ships hovering over
a doomed city and devastating it with missiles
dropped from above are mere fairy tales. Indeed
the whole subject of aeronautics as an
element in future human progress has excited
far more attention than its intrinsic merits
deserve.</p>

<p>A balloon is at the mercy of the wind and must remain so, while a true
flying machine, which supports itself in the air by the operation of
fans or similar devices, may be interesting as a toy, but cannot have
much economical importance for the future. When man has the solid
earth upon which to conduct his traffic, without the necessity of
overcoming the force of gravitation by costly power, he would be
foolish in the extreme to attempt to abandon the advantage which this
gives him, and to commit himself to such an element as the air, in
which the power required to lift himself and his goods would be
immeasurably greater than that needed to transport them from place to
place.</p>

<p>The amount of misdirected ingenuity that has been
expended on these two problems of submarine and aerial
navigation during the nineteenth century will offer one of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
curious and interesting studies to
the future historian of technological progress. Unfortunately that
faculty of the constructive imagination upon which inventive talent
depends may too frequently be indulged by its possessor without any
serious reference to the question of utility. Fancy paints a picture
in which the inventor appears disporting himself at unheard-of depths
below the surface of the sea or at extraordinary heights above the
level of the land, while his friends, his rivals, and all manner of
men and women besides, gaze with amazement! Patent agents are only too
well aware how often an inordinate desire for self-glorification goes
along with real inventive talent, and how many of the brotherhood of
inventors make light of the losses which may be inflicted upon
trusting investors so long as they themselves may get well talked
about.</p>

<p>Nations may at times be infected with this
unpractical vainglory of inventiveness; and
on these occasions there is need of all the
restraining influence of the hard-headed business
man to prevent the waste of enormous
sums of money. The idea that military
ascendency in the future is to be secured by
the ability to fly through the air and to dive for
long distances under the water has taken possession
of certain sections in France, Germany,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Russia, Great Britain and the United States.
Large numbers of voluble "Boulevardiers" in
Paris have, during the last years of the
nineteenth century, made it an article of their
patriotic faith that the future success of the
French navy depends upon the submarine
boat. The question as to what an enemy
would do with such a boat in actual warfare
seems hardly ever to occur to them; and,
indeed, any one who should venture to put
such a query would run the risk of being set
down as a traitor to his country!</p>

<p>More important to the student of the
practical details of naval preparation is the
great question as to the point at which the
contest between shot and armour will be
brought to a standstill. That it cannot proceed
indefinitely may be confidently taken for
granted. The plate-makers thicken their
armour while the gun-makers enlarge the size
and increase the penetrative power of their
weapons, until the weight that has to be
carried on a battle-ship renders the attainment
of speed practically impossible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there is going forward, in the
hull of the vessel itself, a gradual course of
evolution which will eventually place the
policy of increasing strength of armour and
of guns at a discount. The division of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
air-space of a warship into water-tight compartments
will doubtless prove to be, in actual
naval conflict, a more effectual means of keeping
the vessel afloat than the indefinite increase
in the thickness and consequent weight of her
armour.</p>

<p>The most advanced naval architects of
modern times are bestowing more and more
attention upon this feature, as affording a
prospect of rendering ships unsinkable, whether
through accidents or through injury in warfare.
No doubt, for merchant steamers, it
will be seen that development along the
lines already laid down in this department
will suffice for all practical purposes. The
water-tight bulkheads, with readily closed or
automatically shutting doorways, ensure the
maintenance of buoyancy in case of any
ordinary accident from collision or grounding,
while the duplication of engines, shafts and
propellers&mdash;without which no steamship of
the middle twentieth century will be passed
by marine surveyors as fit for carrying passengers
on long ocean voyages&mdash;will make
provision against all excepting the most extremely
improbable mishaps to the machinery.</p>

<p>If the numerical estimate of the chance of
the disablement of a single engine and its
propeller during a certain voyage be stated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
at one to a thousand, then the risk of helplessness
through the break down of both systems
in a vessel having twin screws and entirely
separate engines will be represented by the
proportion of one to a million. This mode of
reckoning, of course, assumes that the two
systems could be made absolutely independent
in relation to all possible disasters; and some
deduction must be made on account of the
impossibility of attaining this ideal. Yet it is
evident that when every practicable device
has been adopted for rendering a double accident
improbable the chances against such a
disaster will not be far from the proportion
stated.</p>

<p>When we come to consider the evolution of
the warship as compared with that of the
merchant steamer, we are at once confronted
with the fact that the infliction of injury upon
the boilers, the engine, or the propellers of a
hostile vessel is the great object aimed at by
the gunners. The evolution of the warship
in the direction of ensuring safety, therefore,
will not stop at the duplication of the engines,
boilers and propellers. In fact it must sooner
or later be apparent that the interests of a
great naval power demand the working out of
a type of warlike craft that shall be almost
entirely destitute of armour, but constructed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
on such a principle&mdash;both as to hull and
machinery&mdash;that she can be raked fore and
aft, and shot through in all directions without
becoming either water-logged or deprived of
her motive power.</p>

<p>A torpedo-boat built on this system may
consist essentially of a series of steel tubes
of large section grouped longitudinally, and
divided into compartments like those of a
bamboo cane. Each of these has its own
small but powerful boilers and engines, and
each its separate propeller at the stern. Care
also is taken to place the machinery of each
tube in such a position that no two are abreast.
In fact, the principle of construction is such
as to render just as remote as may be the
possibility of any shot passing through the
vessel and disabling two at the same time.</p>

<p>If a boat of this description has each tube
furnished not only with a separate screw at
the stern, but also with a torpedo at the bows,
it can offer a most serious menace to even the
most powerful battle-ship afloat, because its
power of "getting home" with a missile depends
not upon its protective precautions, but
upon an appeal to the law of averages, which
makes it practically impossible for any gunners,
however skilful, to disable all its independent
sections during the run from long range to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
torpedo-striking distance. The attacked warship
is like an animal exposed to the onslaught
of one of those fabled reptiles possessing a
separate life and a separate sting in each of
its myriad sections; so that what would be a
mortal injury to a creature having its vital
organs concentrated in one spot produces
only the most limited effect in diminishing its
strength and powers of offence.</p>

<p>Or this class of naval fighter may be regarded
as a combined fleet of small torpedo-boats,
bound together for mutual purposes of
offence and defence. Singly, they would present
defects of coal-carrying capacity, sea-going
qualities, and accommodation for crew which
would render them comparatively helpless and
innocuous; but in combination they possess
all the travelling capacities of a large warship,
conjoined with the deadly powers at close
quarters of a number of torpedo boats, all
acting closely in concert upon a single plan.</p>

<p>The chief naval lesson taught during the
Spanish-American War was the need for improving
the sea-going qualities of the torpedo-boat
before it can be regarded as a truly
effective weapon in naval warfare. It was
announced at one stage that if the Spanish
torpedo-boat fleet could have been coaled and
re-coaled at the Azores, and two or three other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
points on the passage across to America, it
might have been brought within striking distance
of the United States cruisers operating
against Santiago. This hypothetical statement
provided but cold comfort for the
Spaniards, who had been persuaded to put
so much of their available naval strength into
a type of craft utterly unsuited for operations
complying with the first great requirement of
naval warfare, namely, that the proper limit
of the campaign coincides with the shores of
the enemy's country.</p>

<p>But when the naval architect and the engineer
have evolved a class of torpedo-using
vessel which can both travel far and strike
hard, and which, moreover, can stand a few
well-directed shots penetrating her without
succumbing to their effect, a new era will
have been opened up in naval warfare&mdash;an
era of high explosive weapons requiring to
strike home with dash and bravery in spite
of risk from shot and shell; but, like the
bayonet on land, capable of overthrowing all
war-machines which can only strike from a
considerable distance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>MUSIC.</h3>


<p>A perfect <i>sostenuto</i> piano has been the dream
of many a musician whose ardent desire it was
to perform his music exactly as it was written.
A sustained piano note is, indeed, the great
mechanical desideratum for the music of the
future. In music, as at present written and
published for the piano, which is, and must
continue to be, the real "King of Instruments,"
there is a good deal of make-believe.
A long note&mdash;or two notes tied in a certain
method&mdash;is intended to be played as a continued
sound, like the note of an organ; whereas there
is no piano in existence which will produce
anything even approximately approaching to
that effect. The characteristic of the piano
as an instrument is <i>percussion</i>, producing, at
the moment of striking the note, a loud sound
which almost immediately dies away and leaves
but a faint vibration.</p>

<p>The phonographic record of a pianoforte solo
shows this very clearly to the eye, because the
impression made by a long note is a deeply-marked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
indentation succeeded by the merest
shallow scratch&mdash;not unlike the impression
made by a tadpole on mud&mdash;with a big head
and an attenuated body. Every note marked
long in pianoforte music is therefore essentially
a <i>sforzando</i> followed by a rapid <i>diminuendo</i>.
Anything in such music marked as a
long note to be sustained <i>crescendo</i>&mdash;the
most thrilling effect of orchestral, choral, and
organ music&mdash;is necessarily a sham and a
delusion.</p>

<p>The genius and skill which have enabled
the masters of pianoforte composition not
only to cover up this defect in their instrument,
but even to make amends for it, by
working out effects only suitable for a percussion
note, present one of the most remarkable
features of musical progress in the
nineteenth century. So notable is that fact
in its relation to the pianoforte accompaniments
of vocal music, that it seems open to
question whether, even in the presence of a
thoroughly satisfactory <i>sostenuto</i> piano, much
use would for many years be made of it for
this particular purpose. The effects of repeated
notes succeeding one another with increasing
or decreasing force, and of <i>arpeggio</i>
passages, have been so fully explored and
made available in standard music of every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
grade, that necessarily the public taste has
set itself to appreciate the pianoforte solo
and the accompanied song exactly as they
are written and performed. These are, after
all, the highest forms of music which civilisation
has yet enabled one or two performers
to produce.</p>

<p>Yet, in regard to solo instrumentalisation,
there is no doubt that a general hope exists
for the discovery of a compromise between the
piano and the organ or between the piano
and the string band. Some inventors have
aimed in the latter direction and others in the
former; but no one has succeeded in really
recommending his ideas to the public. Combined
piano-violins and piano-organs have been
shown at each of the great Exhibitions from
the middle of the nineteenth century to its
close. Several of these instruments have been
devised and constructed with great ingenuity;
and yet practically all of them have been received
by the musical profession either with
indifference or with positive ridicule.</p>

<p>The fact is that revolutionary sudden changes
in musical instruments are rendered impossible
owing to the near relationship which exists
between each instrument and the general body
of the music that is written for it. No one
can divorce the two, which, as a factor in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
&aelig;sthetic progress, are really one and indivisible.
Therefore, if any man invents a musical instrument
which requires for its success the sudden
evolution of a new race of composers writing
for it, and a new type of educated public taste
to hail these composers with delight, he is
asking for a miracle and he will be disappointed.</p>

<p>What is wanted is not a new instrument,
but an improved piano that shall at one and
the same time correct, to some extent, the
defects of the existing instrument, and leave
still available all the brilliant effects which
have been invented for it by a generation of
musical geniuses. We want the sustained
note, and yet we do not wish to lose the pretty
turns and graceful devices by which the lack
of it has been hidden, or atoned for, in the
works of the masters. Therefore our sustained
note must not be too aggressive. For a long
time, indeed, it must partake of the very defects
which it is intended ultimately to abolish.</p>

<p>In other words, we want to retain the percussion
note with the dampers and with the
loud and soft pedals, in fact, all the existing
inventions for coaxing some of the notes to
sustain themselves while others are cut short,
as may be desired, and at the same time we
have to add other and more effective means to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
assist the performer in achieving the same
object.</p>

<p>The more or less complicated methods aiming
at the prolongation of the residual effect of
the percussion have apparently been very nearly
exhausted. Some of the most modern pianos
are really marvels of mechanical ingenuity applied
to this purpose. We have now to look
to something slightly resembling the principle
of the violin or of the organ, in order to secure
the additional <i>sostenuto</i> effect for which we
are searching. Having to deal with a piano
in practically its existing form, we obviously
require to take special account of the fact that
the note is begun by percussion, and that any
attempt to bring a solid substance into contact
with the wire while still vibrating, with the
object of continuing its motion, is likely to
produce more or less of a jarring effect.</p>

<p>The air-blast type of note-continuer for <i>sostenuto</i>
effect therefore offers the most promising
outlook for the improvement of the modern
piano in the direction indicated. By directing
a blast of air from a very thin nozzle on to the
vibrating wire of a piano, the sound emitted
may be very greatly intensified; and although
naturally the decreasing amplitude of the
vibration may in itself tend to create a <i>diminuendo</i>,
yet it is possible to make up for this in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
some degree by causing the air-blast to increase
in force, through the use of any suitable means,
modified by an extra pedal as may be desired.</p>

<p>Delicate <i>pianissimo</i> effects, somewhat resembling
those of the Eolian lyre, are produced
by playing the notes with the air-blast alone,
without the aid of percussion. But the louder
<i>sostenuto</i> notes depend upon the added atmospheric
resistance offered by a strong current
of air to those movements of the wire which
have been originally set up by percussion, and
the fact that this resistance gives rise to a
corresponding continuance of the motion. The
prolongation of a note in this way is analogous
to the continual swinging of an elastic switch
in a stream of water, the current by its force
producing a rhythmic movement.</p>

<p>When these Eolian effects, as applied to the
pianoforte, have been carefully studied, many
devices for controlling them will be brought
forward. The main purpose, however, must
be to connect the air-blast with the percussion
apparatus in such a manner that, as soon as a
key is depressed, the nozzle of that particular
note in the air-blast is opened exactly at the
same time that the wire is struck by the
hammer, and it remains open as long as the
note is held down. The movement of an
extra pedal, however, has the effect of throwing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the whole of the air-blast apparatus out of
gear and reducing the piano to a percussion
instrument, pure and simple.</p>

<p>It will be on the concert platform, no doubt, that this kind of
improvement will find its first field of usefulness. Performers will
require, in addition to their grand pianos, reservoirs of compressed
air attachable by tubes to their instruments. In private houses
hydraulic air-compressors will be found more convenient. When the
piano has by some such means acquired the faculty of <i>singing</i> its
notes, as well as of <i>ringing</i> them, its ascendency, as the finest
instrument adapted to solo instrumentalism, will be assured.</p>

<p>The common domestic piano is rightly regarded
by many people as being little better
than an instrument of torture. One reason
for this aversion is that, in the great majority
of cases, the household instrument is not kept
in tune. Probably it is not too much to say
that the man who would invent a sound cottage
piano which would remain in tune would do
more for the improvement of the national
taste in music than the largest and finest
orchestra ever assembled. The constantly
vitiated sense of hearing, which is brought
about by the continual jangle of notes just a
fractional part of a tone out of tune, is responsible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
for much of the distaste for good
music which prevails among the people. When
the domestic instrument is but imperfectly
tuned, it is natural that those pieces should be
preferred which suffer least by reason of the
imperfection, and these, it need hardly be remarked,
generally belong to the class of music
which must be rated as essentially inferior, if
not vulgar.</p>

<p>The device of winding a string round a peg
and twisting it up on the latter in order to
obtain tension for a vibrating note is thousands
of years old. It was the method by which
tension was imparted to some of the earliest
harps and lyres of which history is cognisant;
and it is still to be found to-day in the most
elaborate and costly grand piano, with but
few alterations affecting its principle of action.
The pianoforte of the future will be kept in
tune by more exact and scientific methods,
attaining a certain balance between the thickness
of the wire and the tension placed upon
it by means of springs and weights.</p>

<p>Besides the ravages of the badly-tuned piano,
much suffering is inflicted by the barbarous
habit of permitting a sounding instrument to
be used for mere mechanical exercises. The
taste of the pupil is vitiated, and the nerves
of other inmates of the house are subjected to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
a source of constant irritation when long series
of notes, arranged merely as muscular exercises,
and some of them violating almost every rule
of musical form, are ground out hour after
hour like coffee from a coffee-mill. The inconsistency
of subjecting the musical ear and
taste of a boy or girl to this process, and then
expecting the child to develop an innate taste
for the delicacies of form in melody and of
the beauty of harmony, is almost as bad as
would be that of asking a Chinese victim of
foot-binding to walk easily and gracefully.</p>

<p>The use of the digitorium for promoting
the mechanical portion of a musical education
by the training of the fingers has already, to
some slight extent, obviated the evils complained
of. But this instrument is, as yet,
only in its rudimentary stage of development.
The dumb notes of the keyboard ought to be
capable of emitting sounds by way of notice
to the operator, in order to show when the
rules have been broken. Thus, for instance,
the impact caused by putting a key down
should have the effect of driving a small
weight upwards in the direction of a metal
bar, the distance of which can be adjusted.
Another bar, at a lower level, is also approached
by a second weight, and the perfect degree of
evenness in the touch is indicated by the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
that the lower bar should be made to emit
a faint sound with every note, but the higher
one not at all. The closer the bars the more
difficult is the exercise, and remarkable evenness
of touch can be acquired by a progressive
training with such an instrument.</p>

<p>The organ has been wonderfully improved
during the nineteenth century. Yet the decline
of its popularity in comparison with the pianoforte
may be accounted for on very rational
grounds. While ardent organists still claim
that the organ is the "King of Instruments"
the public generally entertain a feeling that it
is a deposed king. It remains for the organ-builders
of the twentieth century to attack
the problem of curing its defects by methods
going more directly to the root of the difficulty
than any hitherto attempted.</p>

<p>As contrasted with the pianoforte, the organ
is extremely deficient in that power which the
conductor of an orchestra loves to exercise&mdash;facility
in accentuating and in subduing at
will the work of each individual performer.
For all practical purposes the ten fingers of
a piano-player are the ten players in an
orchestra; and, according to the force with
which each finger strikes the note, is the prominence
given to its effects. An air or a <i>motif</i>
may be brought out with emphasis by one set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
of fingers, while the others are playing an
accompaniment with all sorts of delicate
gradations of softness and emphasis.</p>

<p>By multiplying the manuals, the organ-builder
has endeavoured, with a certain degree
of success, to make up for the unfortunate fact
that the performer on his instrument possesses
no similar facility in making it speak louder
when he submits the note to extra pressure.
One hand may be playing an air on one
manual, while the second is engaged in the
accompaniment on another; and the former
may be connected with a louder stop, or
with one of a more penetrating quality than
the latter.</p>

<p>This device, together with an elaborate
arrangement of swells and pedal-notes, has
greatly enlarged the capacity of the organ for
producing those choral effects which mainly
depend upon gradations of volume. Yet the
whole system, elaborate as it is, offers but a
poor substitute for the marvellous range of
individuality that may be expressed on the
notes of the piano by instantaneous changes
in the values ascribed to single notes. By the
same action of his finger the pianist not only
makes the note, but also gives its value; while
the method of the organist is to neglect the
element of finger-pressure and to rely upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
other methods for imparting emphasis or softness
to his work.</p>

<p>An organ that shall emit a louder or softer
note, according to the force with which the
key on the manual is depressed, will no doubt
be one of the musical instruments of the
twentieth century. Whether each key will
be fitted with a resisting spring, or whether
the lever will be constructed in such a way as
to throw a weight to a higher or lower grade
of position, according to the force with which
it is struck, is a question which will depend
upon the results of experiment. But the latter
method is more in consonance with the conditions
which have given to the piano its
wonderful versatility, and it therefore seems
the more probable solution of the two. Upon
the vigour of the finger's impact will depend
the height to which a valve is thrown, and
this will determine the speed and volume of
the air which is liberated to rush into the pipe
and make the note.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century orchestra is a fearfully
and wonderfully constructed agglomeration
of ancient and modern instruments. Its
merits are attested by the fine musical sense
of the most experienced conductors, whose
aim it has been so to balance the different
instruments as to produce a tastefully-blended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
effect, while at the same time providing for
solos and also for the rendering of parts in
which a small number of performers may
contribute to the unfolding of the composer's
ideas. The orchestra cannot therefore be
examined or discussed from a mechanical
point of view, however much some of the
instruments of which it is composed may be
thought capable of improvement.</p>

<p>But the position of the conductor himself
in the front of an orchestra is, from a purely
artistic standpoint, highly anomalous. It is
as if the prompter at the performance of a
drama were to be seen taking the most conspicuous
part and mixing among the actors
upon the stage. If an orchestral piece be
well played without the visible presence of
a conductor, the sense of correct time reaches
the audience naturally through the music
itself; and any sort of gesticulations intended
to mark it are under these conditions regarded
as being out of place.</p>

<p>The foremost orchestral conductors of the
day are evidently impressed with this unfitness
of the mechanical marking of time by the
wild waving of a stick or swaying of the body;
and accordingly, however much they exert
themselves at the rehearsal, they purposely
subdue their motions during a public performance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
The time is not far distant when the
object of the conductor will be to guide his
band without permitting his promptings to be
perceived in any way by the audience.</p>

<p>For this purpose an "electric beat-indicator"
will prove useful. Various proposals for its
application have been put forward, and for
different purposes several of them are obviously
feasible. For instance, in one system
the conductor sits in a place hidden from the
audience and beats time on an electric contact-maker,
which admits of his sending a
special message to any particular performer
whenever he desires to do so. The signal
which marks the time may be given to each
performer, either visually by a beater concealed
within a small bell-shaped cavity affixed to his
desk or to his electric light; or it may be conveyed
by the sense of touch through a mechanical
beater within a small metal weight placed
on the floor and upon which he sets one of
his feet.</p>

<p>The electric time-beater in the latter system
thus taps the measure gently on the sole of
the performer's foot, and special signals, as
may be arranged, are sent to him by preconcerted
combinations of taps. The absence of
any distraction from the music itself will soon
be gratefully felt by audiences, and the playing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of a symphony in the twentieth century, in
which the whole orchestra moves sympathetically
in obedience to the "nerve-waves" of the
electric current, will be the highest possible
presentment of the musical art.</p>

<h3>ART AND NEWS.</h3>


<p>The production of pictures for the million will
be practically the highest achievement of the
graphic art in the twentieth century. Many
eminent painters do not at all relish the prospect,
being strongly of opinion that when
every branch of art becomes popular it will be
vulgarised. This notion arises from a fallacy
which has affected ideas during the nineteenth
century in many matters besides art, the
mistake of supposing that vulgar people all
belong to one grade of society.</p>

<p>Yet every one who knows modern England,
for instance, is perfectly aware that the highest
standard of taste is only to be found in the
elect of all classes of society. After the experience
of the eighteenth century, surely it
ought to have been recognised that the "upper
ten thousand," when left to develop vulgarity
in its true essence, can attain to a degree of
perfection hardly possible in any other social
grade. Is there in the whole range of pictorial
art anything more irredeemably vulgar than a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
"State Portrait" by Sir Thomas Lawrence or
one of his imitators?</p>

<p>It was under the prompting of a dread of
the process of popularising art that so many
eminent painters of the nineteenth century
protested against the fashion set by Sir J. E.
Millais when he sold such pictures as "Cherry
Ripe" and "Bubbles," knowing they were intended
for reproduction in very large numbers
by mechanical means. From a somewhat
similar motive a few of the leading artists of
the nineteenth century for a time stood aloof
from the movement for familiarising the people
with at least the form, if not the colouring, of
each notable picture of the year. From small
and very unpretentious beginnings, the published
pictorial notes of the Royal Academy
and other exhibitions of the year have risen to
most imposing proportions; and already there
is some talk of attempting a few of the best
from each year's production in colours.</p>

<p>Half-tone zinco and similar processes have
brought down the expenses entailed by reproductions
in colour-work, so as to render an
undertaking of this kind much more feasible
than it was in the middle of the last half-century.
"Cherry Ripe" cost five thousand
pounds to reproduce, by the laborious processes
of printing not only each colour, but almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
every different shade of each colour from a
different surface.</p>

<p>In the "three-colour-zinco" process of reproduction
only three printings are required,
each colour with all its delicate gradations of
shade being fully provided for by a single
engraved block. When machines of great
precision have been finally perfected for admitting
of the successive blocks being printed
from on paper run from the reel without any
handling, a revolution will be brought about
not only in artistic printing, but even in the
conditions of studio work upon which the
artist depends for success.</p>

<p>First, the pictorial notes of the year will be
brought out in colour; and as competition for
the right of reproduction increases, the artists
who have painted the most suitable and most
popular pictures will find that they can get
more remuneration for copyright than they
can for the pictures themselves. This has
already been the case in regard to a very
limited number of pictures; but the exception
of the past will be the rule of the future, at
least as regards those pictures which possess
any special merits at all.</p>

<p>More thought will therefore be required as
the motive or basis of each subject; and historical
pictures will come more into favour,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the affected simplicity and mental emptiness
of the <i>plein air</i> school being discarded in
favour of a style which shall speak more directly
to the people, and stir more deeply both their
mental and their emotional natures.</p>

<p>The artist and the printer must then confer.
They can no longer afford to work in the future
with such disregard of each other's ideas and
methods as they have done in the past. It
was at one time the custom among painters
almost to despise the "black-and-white man"
who drew for the Press in any shape or form;
but that piece of affectation has nearly been
destroyed by the general ridicule with which
it is now received, and by the knowledge that
there are already, at the end of the nineteenth
century, just as many men of talent working
by methods suitable for reproduction, as there
are painters who confine their attention to
palette, canvas and brush.</p>

<p>The printer will now advance a step further,
and will invoke the services of the painter
himself, even prescribing certain methods by
which the Press may be enabled to reproduce
the work of the artist more faithfully than
would otherwise be possible.</p>

<p>Transparency painting will no doubt be one
of these methods. The artist will paint on a
set of sheets of transparent celluloid or glass,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
mounted in frames of wood and hinged so that
they can, for purposes of observation, be put
aside and yet brought back to their original
positions quite accurately. Each different
transparent sheet will be intended for one
pure colour, the only pigments used being
of the most transparent description obtainable.</p>

<p>The picture may thus be built up by successive
additions and alterations, not all put
upon one surface, but constituting a number
of "monochromes," superimposed one upon the
other. When finished, each of these one-colour
transparencies can then be reproduced
by photo-mechanical means for multi-colour
printing in the press.</p>

<p>By what are known as the photographic
"interruption" processes, a kind of converse
method has achieved a certain degree of success.
A landscape or a picture is photographed
several times from exactly the same position,
but on each occasion it is taken through a
screen of a different coloured glass, which is
intended for the purpose of intercepting all
the rays of light, except those of one particular
tint. Coloured prints in transparent gelatine
or other suitable medium are then made
from the various negatives, each in its appropriate
tint; and when all are placed together
and viewed through transmitted light, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
effect of the picture, with all its colours combined,
is fairly well produced. More serviceable
from the artistic point of view will be
the method according to which the artist
makes his picture by transmitted light, but
the finished printed product is seen on paper,
because this latter lends itself to the finest
work of the artistic printer.</p>

<p>The principal branch of the work of the
photographer must continue to be portraiture.
He cannot greatly reduce the cost of
getting a really good negative, because so
much hand-labour is required for the task
of "retouching"; but he can give, perhaps,
a hundred prints for the price which he now
charges for a dozen, and make money by the
enterprise. It has already been proved that
there is no necessity for using expensive salts
of gold, silver or platinum in order to secure
the most artistic prints; and, as a matter of
fact, some of the finest art work in the photography
of the past quarter of a century has
been accomplished with the cheapest of materials,
such as gelatine, glue and lampblack.</p>

<p>Pigmented gelatine is, without doubt, the
coming medium for photographic prints, and
the methods of making them must approximate
more and more closely to those of the
typographic printer. By producing a "photo-relief"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
in gelatine&mdash;sensitised with bichromate
of potash, and afterwards exposed first to the
sun and then to the action of water&mdash;an impression
in plastic material can be secured,
from which, with the use of warm, thin, pigmented
gelatine, a hundred copies or more
can be printed off in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The very general introduction of such a
process has naturally been delayed owing to
the extra trouble involved in the first methods
which were suggested for applying it, and also,
no doubt, on account of the recent fashion for
platinotype and bromide of silver prints. But
as soon as more convenient details for the
making of pigmented gelatine prints have been
elaborated, the cheapness of the material and
the wonderful variety of the art shades and
tints in which photographs can be executed
will give the gelatine processes an advantage
in the competition which it will be hopeless
for other methods to challenge.</p>

<p>The daily newspapers of a few years hence
will be vividly illustrated with photographic
pictures of the personages and the events of
the day. The gelatine photo-relief, already
alluded to, will no doubt afford the basis of
the principal processes by which this will be
effected. Hitherto the chief drawback has
been the difficulty of imparting a suitable grain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
to the printing blocks made from these reliefs;
but this has been practically overcome by the
use of sheets of metallic foil previously impressed
with the form of a finely-engraved
tint-block. The actual printing surface, of
course, consists of an electrotype or stereotype
taken from this metallic-grained photographic
face.</p>

<p>For "high-art" printing on fine paper with
the more expensive kinds of ink, the half-tone
zinco processes will doubtless maintain their
supremacy and gradually diminish the area
within which lithographic printing is required.
In the case of newspaper work, however, where
haste in getting ready for the press is necessarily
the prime consideration, the flat and
very slightly-indented surface of the zinco
block is found to be unsuited to the requirements.
Flat blocks, which require careful
"overlaying" on the machine, waste too much
time for daily news work. Without going
into technical details it may be surmised in
general terms that in the near future almost
every newspaper will contain, each day, one
or more photo-illustrations of events of the
previous day or of the news which has come
to hand from a distance.</p>

<p>Type-setting by hand is, for newspaper purposes,
being so rapidly superseded, that only in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the smaller towns and villages can it remain
for even a few years longer. But in the
machines by which this revolution has been
effected, finality has been by no means reached.
Every line of matter which appears in any
modern daily newspaper has to pass through
two processes of stereotyping before it makes
a beginning to effect its final work of printing
upon paper.</p>

<p>First, there is the stereotyping or casting of
the line in its position in the type-setting
machine after the matrices have been ranged
in position by the application of the fingers to
the various keys; and, secondly, when all the
lines have been placed together to make a
page, it is necessary to take an impression of
them upon <i>papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;</i>, or what is technically
called "flong," and then to dry it and make
the full cast from it curved and ready for
placing on the cylinder of the printing machine.
The delay occasioned by the need for drying
the wet flong is such a serious matter&mdash;particularly
to evening newspapers requiring many
editions during the afternoon&mdash;that several dry
methods have been tried with greater or less
success.</p>

<p>But there is really no need for more than
one casting process. In the twentieth century
machine the matrices will be replaced by permanent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
type from which, when ranged in the
line, an impression will be made by hard pressure
on a small bar of soft metal or plastic
material. All the impressed bars having been
set together in a casting box having the necessary
curvature, the final stereo plate for printing
from will be taken at once by pouring melted
metal on the combined bars.</p>

<p>An appreciable saving, both in time and
in money, will also be effected by applying the
principle of the perforated strip of paper or
cardboard to the purpose of operating the
machine by which the necessary letters are
caused to range themselves in the required
order. Machines similar to typewriters will
be employed for perforating the strips of paper
and for printing, at the same time, in ordinary
letters the matter just as if it were being typewritten.</p>

<p>The corrections can then be made by cutting
off those pieces of the strips which are wrong
and inserting corrected pieces in their places.
No initial "justification" to the space required
to make a line is needed in this system. The
strips, however, are put through the setting
machine, and, as they make the reading matter
by the impression of bars as already described,
they are divided into lines automatically.</p>

<p>Large numbers of newspapers will in future
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
be sold from "penny-in-the-slot" machines.
The system to be adopted for this particular
purpose will doubtless differ in some important
respects from that which has been successful in
the vending of small articles such as sweetmeats
and cigarettes. The newspapers may be hung
on light bars within the machine, these being
supported at the end by a carefully-adjusted
cross piece, which, on the insertion of a penny
in the slot, moves just sufficiently to permit the
end of one bar with its newspaper to drop, and
to precipitate the latter on to a table forming
the front of the machine. When the full complement
of newspapers has been exhausted
the slot is automatically closed.</p>

<p>Some of the newspapers of the twentieth
century will be given away gratis, and will be,
for the most part, owned by the principal
advertisers. This is the direction in which
journalistic property is now tending, and at
any juncture steps might be taken, in one or
other of the great centres of newspaper enterprise,
which would precipitate the ultimate
movement. Hardly any one who buys a half-penny
paper to-day imagines for a moment
that there is any actual profit on the article.</p>

<p>It is understood on all hands that the advertisers
keep the newspapers going and that the
arrangement is mutually beneficial. Not that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
either party can dictate to the other in matters
outside of its own province. The effect is
simply to permit the great public to purchase
its news practically for the price of the paper
and ink on which it is conveyed; the condition
being that the said public will permit its eyes
to be greeted with certain announcements
placed in juxtaposition to the news and
comments.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, therefore, the idea will occur
to some of the leading advertisers to form a
syndicate and give to the people a small broadsheet
containing briefly the daily narrative.
The ponderous newspapers of the latter end
of the nineteenth century&mdash;filled full of enough
of linotype matter to occupy more than the
whole day of the subscriber in their perusal&mdash;will
be to a large extent dispensed with; and
the new art of journalism will consist in saying
things as briefly&mdash;not as lengthily&mdash;as possible.</p>

<h3>INVENTION AND COLLECTIVISM.</h3>


<p>The ownership of machinery and of all the
varied appliances in the evolution of which
inventive genius is exercised is a matter which,
strictly speaking, does not belong to the
domain of this work. Nevertheless, in endeavouring
to forecast the progress of invention
during the twentieth century, it is
necessary to take count of the risks involved
in the inauguration of any public and social
economical systems which might tend to stifle
freedom of thought and to discourage the
efforts of those who have suggestions of industrial
improvements to make.</p>

<p>It is plain that those economic forces which
prevent the inventor from having his ideas
tested must to that extent retard the progress
of industrial improvement. Thousands of men,
who imagine that they possess the inventive
talent in a highly developed degree, are either
crack-brained enthusiasts or else utterly unpractical
men whose services would never be
worth anything at all in the work of attacking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
difficult mechanical problems. It is in the task
of discriminating between this class and the
true inventors that many industrial organizers
fail. Any economic system which offers inducements
to the directors of industrial enterprises
to shirk the onerous, and at times very
irksome, duty of sifting out the good from the
bad must stand condemned not only on account
of its wastefulness, but by reason of its baneful
effects in the discouragement of inventive
genius.</p>

<p>Considerations of this kind lead to the conclusion
that during the twentieth century the
spread of collectivist or socialistic ideas, and
the adoption of methods of State and municipal
control of production and transport may have
an important bearing upon the progress of
civilisation through the adoption of new inventions.
Many thinking men and women of
the present generation are inclined to believe
<i>the</i> twentieth century invention <i>par excellence</i>
will be the bringing of all the machinery of
production, transport and exchange under the
official control of persons appointed by the
State or by the municipality, and therefore
amenable to the vote of the people. Projects
of collectivism are in the air, and high hopes
are entertained that the twentieth century will
be far more distinctively marked by the revolution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
which it will witness in the social and
industrial organisation of the people than in
the improvements effected in the mechanical
and other means for extending man's powers
over natural forces.</p>

<p>The average official naturally wishes to
retain his billet. That is the main motive
which governs nearly all his official acts; and
in the treatment which he usually accords to
the inventor he shows this anxiety perhaps
more clearly than in any other class of the
actions of his administration. He wants to
make no mistakes, but whether he ever scores
a distinct and decided success is comparatively
a matter of indifference to him. So long as he
does not give a handle to his enemies to be
used against him, he is fairly contented to go
on from year to year in a humdrum style.</p>

<p>Even a man of fine feeling and progressive
ideas soon experiences the numbing effects of
the routine life after he has been a few years
in office. He knows that he will be judged
rather on the negative than on the positive
principle, that is to say, for the things which it
is accounted he ought not to have done rather
than for the more enterprising good things
which it is admitted he may have done.</p>

<p>Now any one who undertakes to encourage
invention must necessarily make mistakes. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
may indeed know that one case of brilliant
success will make up for half a dozen comparative
failures; but he reckons that at any
rate the blanks in the chances which he is
taking will numerically exceed the prizes. An
official, however, will not dare to draw blanks.
Better for him to draw nothing at all. He
must therefore turn his back upon the inventor
and approve of nothing which has not been
shown to be a great success elsewhere.</p>

<p>This means that the socialised and municipalised enterprises must
always lag behind those depending upon private effort; and the country
which imposes disabilities on the latter must, for a time at least,
lose its lead in the industrial race. This is what happened to
England, as contrasted with the United States, when, under the
influence of enthusiasm for future municipalisation, the British
Legislature laid heavy penalties upon those who should venture to
instal electric trams in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The American manufacturers and tramway
companies, in their keen competition with one
another and perfect freedom to compete on
even terms with horse traction, soon took the
lead in all matters pertaining to electric traction,
and the British public, at the close of the
nineteenth century, have had to witness the
humiliating spectacle of their own public
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
authorities being forced to import electrical
apparatus, and even steam-engines applicable
to dynamos used for tramway purposes, from
the other side of the Atlantic!</p>

<p>The lesson thus enforced will not in the
end be missed, although it may require a
considerable time to be fully understood.
Officialism is a foe to inventive progress;
and whether it exists under a regime of
collectivism or under one of autocracy, it
must paralyse industrial enterprise to that
extent, thus rendering the country which has
adopted it liable to be outstripped by its
competitors.</p>

<p>The true friend of inventive progress is
generally the rising competitor in a busy hive
of industry where the difficulties of securing
a profitable footing are very considerable.
Such a man is ever on the watch for an opportunity
to gain some leverage by which he
may raise himself to a level with older-established
or richer competitors. If he be a good
employer his workmen enter into the spirit
of the competition, feeling that promotion
will follow on any services they may render.
They may perhaps possess the inventive talent
themselves, or they may do even greater services
by recognising it in others and co-operating
in their work. It is thus that successful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
inventions are usually started on their useful
careers.</p>

<p>It is therefore upon private enterprise that
the principal onus of advancing the inventions
which will contribute to the progress of the
human race in the twentieth century must
necessarily fall. The type of man who will
cheerfully work <i>pro bono publico</i>, with just as
much ardour as he would exhibit when labouring
to advance his own interests, may already
be found here and there in civilised communities
at existing stages of development; but it
is not sufficiently numerous to enable the
world to dispense with the powerful stimulus
of competition.</p>

<p>Just as a superior type of machinery can be
elaborated during the course of a single century,
there is no doubt that&mdash;mainly through
the use of improved appliances for lessening
the amount of brute force which man needs
to exert in his daily avocations&mdash;the nervous
organisations of the men and women constituting
the rank and file during the latter part
of the twentieth century will be immensely
improved in sensitiveness. A corresponding
advance will then take place in the capacity
for collectivism. But a human being of the
high class demanded for the carrying out of
any scheme of State socialism must be bred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
by a slow improvement during successive
generations. A hundred years do not constitute
a long period of time in the process of
the organic evolution of the human race, and,
as Tennyson declared,</p>

<p>
<span style='margin-left:4em;'>We are far from the noon of man&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left:4em;'>There is time for the race to grow.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Yet the public advantages of collectivist
activities in certain particular directions cannot
for a moment be denied. Much waste
and heavy loss are entailed by the duplication
of works of general utility by rival owners,
each of them, perhaps, only half utilising the
full capacities of his machinery or of the other
plant upon which capital has been expended.</p>

<p>Moreover, as soon as companies have become
so large that their managers and other officials
are brought into no closer personal relations
with the shareholders than the town clerks,
engineers, and surveyors of cities, and the
departmental heads of State bureaus are associated
with the voters and ratepayers, the
systems of private and of collective ownership
begin to stand much more nearly on a par as
regards the non-encouragement which they
offer to inventiveness.</p>

<p>One of the greatest discoveries of the twentieth
century, therefore, will be the adoption
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
of a <i>via media</i> which will admit of the progressiveness
of private ownership in promoting
industrial inventions, combined with the
political progressiveness of collectivism. One
direction in which an important factor assisting
in the solution of this problem is to be expected
is in the removal of the causes which
tend to make public officials so timid and
unprogressive.</p>

<p>So long as a mere temporary outcry about the apparent non-success of
some adopted improvement&mdash;whose real value perhaps cannot be proved
unless by the exercise of patience&mdash;may result in the dismissal or in
the disrating of the official who has recommended it, just so long
will all those who are called upon to act as guides to public
enterprises be compelled to stick to the most conservative lines in
the exercise of their duties. More assurance of permanence in
positions of public administration is needed.</p>

<p>The man upon whose shoulders rests the
responsibility of adopting, or of condemning,
new proposals brought before him, ostensibly
in the interests of the public welfare, ought to
be regarded as being called upon to carry out
<i>quasi</i>-judicial functions; and his tenure of office,
and his claim to a pension after a busy career,
ought not to depend upon the chances of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
evanescent politics of the day. If a man has
proved, by his close and successful application
to the study of his profession&mdash;as evinced in
the tests which he has passed as a youth and
during his subsequent career in subordinate
positions&mdash;that he is really a lover of hard
work, and imbued with conscientious devotion
to duty, he may generally be trusted, when he
has attained to a position of superintendence,
to do his utmost in the interests of the public
whom he serves. This is the theory upon
which the appointment of a judge in almost
any English-speaking community is understood
to be made; and, although failures in its application
may occur now and then, there is no
doubt whatever that on the average of cases
it works out well in practice.</p>

<p>If private manufacturers, whose success in
life depends upon their appreciation of talent
and inventiveness, could be assured that in
dealing with public officials they would be
brought into contact with men of the standing
indicated, instead of being confronted so frequently
with the demand for commissions and
other kinds of solatium on account of the risks
undertaken in recommending anything new,
they would soon largely modify their distrust
of what is known as collectivism. It is the
duty of the public whose servant an official is,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
rather than of the private manufacturer, to
insure him against the danger of losing his
position on account of any possible mistake
in the exercise of his judgment.</p>

<p>In short, the day is not far distant when
the men upon whom devolves the responsibility
of examining into, and reporting upon, the
claims of those who profess to have made important
industrial improvements will be looked
upon as exercising judicial functions of the
very highest type. When the important reforms
arising from this recognition have been
introduced, the forces of collectivism will cease
to range themselves on the side of stolid conservatism
in industry, as they undoubtedly have
done in the nineteenth century even while they
inconsistently professed to advance the cause
of progress politically.</p>

<p>The inventor, who in the early part of the nineteenth century was
generally denounced as a public enemy, will, in the latter part of the
twentieth century, be hailed as a benefactor to the community, because
he will be judged by the ultimate, rather than by the immediate, effects
of his work, and because it will be the duty of the public authorities
to see to it that the dislocation of one industry incidental the promotion
of another by any invention does not, on the whole, operate to throw people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
out of employment, but, on the contrary, gives more constant work and
better wages to all. But the slow progress of the fundamental traits
of human nature will retard the attainment of this goal. The world has
a long distance to travel in the uphill road of industrial and social
improvement before it can succeed in obtaining a really true view of
the part fulfilled by inventive genius in contributing to human
happiness.</p>
